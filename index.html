It&#39;s a combination that&#39;s going to get her killed one day - but not just yet.<br/> That is, until she just gets a job on a tiny trade ship with a nasty reputation for surprises. The Glorious Fool isn&#39;t misnamed: it likes to get into trouble, so much so that one year of security work under its captain is equal to five years everywhere else. With odds like that, Devi knows she&#39;s found the perfect way to get the jump on the next part of her Plan. But the Fool doesn&#39;t give up its secrets without a fight, and one year on this ship might be more than even Devi can handle.</td>

But... I feel at peace when I am near Vanessa. She is like a warm lantern to me. I think it must be because she loves me so obviously. When I am around her, I do not need to pretend to be something I am not.”</td>

I said that you should have first sent flowers with your calling card, and then come to call... perhaps tomorrow, during the proper hours. That is the way of things. Mr Lowe told me that you are not always aware of societal expectations, and so I thought you might appreciate plain speaking.”<br/>       Elias drew himself up with a long, steadying breath. Dora wondered for a moment whether he might lose what little composure he had gathered. But after that moment, he controlled himself, and forced a sardonic smile. “I see. You will have to forgive my ineptness, Miss Ettings. I am obliged to you for your advice.”<br/>       Dora did not really mean to drive Elias off, however, given that he had come for her benefit. Since the butler was still staring at him aghast, and not looking in Dora’s direction, she gave Elias a very stately, serious sort of wink. “I would hate to inconvenience you, however. I hope that the countess will not despise me if I invite you in for some tea. I shall have to ask her, you understand, since I am currently her guest.”<br/>       “Of course,” Elias said dryly. He settled himself back against the door frame. “I will wait ever-so-patiently.</td>

He looked towards Dora hesitantly. “Are you up to helping with that?”<br/>       Roger blanched at that, and Dora tightened her hand on his reassuringly. She knitted her brow. “I can perform all manner of different stitches,” Dora informed Albert. “But I have never tried to stitch up skin before. I am willing to try it, I suppose.”<br/>       Albert blinked at her. “I was certainly not suggesting you should stitch him up yourself!” he said, aghast. “I only hoped for you to hold the skin together for me while I did the deed.” He paused, and added: “That is bad enough, I realise.</td>

I cannot help but forgive such earnest grief, since it is caused by such earnest love. But I beg you to remember the effect you may have when you forget yourself.” She drew in another breath. “And I... will ask that you do not leave bridges unmended with my son. If you come inside now, I swear that all shall be forgotten on my side. Talk with Albert.

Tired as he was, there was no hint in him of the desperate anger she had seen only a day prior.

I did not come here simply to dance.” He cleared his throat slightly. “I have again had little success today. I found myself sitting alone in the dark, tired and bitter.

She was embarrassed to realise that indeed, nearly half of her interactions with strangers had been about the weather after all. Thankfully, she had many other interactions to call upon. “If one were to breed a dolphin with a horse,” Dora said ponderously, “would the resulting creature have a dolphin’s head and a horse’s end, or would it be the other way around?”<br/>       “Oh!” Lord Blackthorn said. “Well clearly, the creature would have a dolphin’s head.

There was something distinctly different about these flowers, however—and after a moment of looking at them, Dora realised that they sometimes looked more like mist than like roses. Those are from Hollowvale’s gardens, she thought.<br/>       “These are for you, Miss Ettings,” Lady Carroway told Dora. “I think they are to entice you downstairs.” She settled the flowers onto the dresser and shook her head with a smile. “The Lord Sorcier would like a private audience with you. We all know he is not here to ask about French translations. Should I have him wait downstairs while you dress, or turn him away in order to save his pride?”<br/>       Vanessa caught the implication in a moment, having just finished her own private audience with Edward only a few days prior.

I still am.”<br/>       “Would you not argue with me for once?” Elias said with a flush. “Listen here, Miss Ettings! I am in love with you. You deserve to hear that. I love your wit and cleverness. I love that you are kind but almost never nice. I love your eyes and your hair and your freckles, and the fact that you smell like some monstrous floral perfume all of the time.” He paused, now looking somewhat offended at himself. “And I love to dance with you. That is the worst of it by far.”<br/>       Dora blinked slowly. Each word heated up her heart bit by bit until it was a bewildering bonfire. That fire burned its way down into her mind, consuming all of the ugly things that still lingered beneath its surface. When she was alone or tired or uncertain, Dora knew that these would be the words that came to her now instead of all those others, and she could not help but smile in a silly, dreamy way.<br/>       “And obviously,” Elias said with a huff, “I would like to marry you.

<td>Dora had the distinct pleasure of attending her cousin’s wedding brunch with her fiancée on her arm. It was everything that a proper wedding brunch ought to be—and more besides. Elias had been in an unusually pleasant mood for weeks by then, and he was feeling so whimsical that he made the swan-folded napkins get up and flutter around for everyone’s entertainment. Vanessa’s resulting smile was nearly a magic spell all on its own.<br/>       Dora’s own wedding was small, but Lady Carroway insisted on hosting a brunch at Carroway House for her as well. Albert’s mother had not forgotten her plans to open another orphanage, and much of the morning’s conversation ended up scandalously centred around those plans, rather than around the weather or the wedding. Dora thought it was the perfect sort of brunch.<br/>       Life after marriage was much different than Dora might ever have imagined. In fact, it was much better in nearly every possible way—but she suspected that had much to do with her choice of husband. As a married woman, she was far more free to spend her time as she pleased; and since she was of a mind with Elias on most things, he was only too happy to let her roll up her sleeves to help both Mrs Dun and the new orphanage. Most women of the nobility had only a few children, Dora liked to say—but she had very many, and she loved them all the same. And though it was rare for Dora to feel any sense of breathless joy, she carried with her always a soft, contented glow, rather like the star upon her finger.<br/>       The ton soon began to murmur that married life quite agreed with the Lord Sorcier; for while Elias would never be well-mannered, he was certainly distinctly happier. There were times, of course, when dark things threatened and great evils endangered his rest—but if he sometimes came home to sit awake in the dark, Dora always insisted at least on being with him.<br/></td>

<td>Yet it had been Cape who transformed the family fortunes with his apples. When he was eighteen, he began attending classes at the hortischool extension in Longwalk, very much against GiGo’s wishes. He had paid tuition out of money earned doing odd jobs around the village—another pointless diversion from home chores that irritated his parents. Cape had become interested in fruit trees after brown rot spoiled almost the entire crop of Littleton’s sour cherries the year before. All the farmers in the village raised fruit, but their orchards were usually no more than a dozen trees, all of traditional heirloom varieties. Crops were small, usually just enough for home use because of the ravages of pests and disease. Farmers battled Terran immigrants like tarnished plant bugs, sawflies, wooly aphids, coddling moths, leafrollers, lesser apple worms, and the arch enemy: plum curculio. There were mildews, rusts, rots, cankers, blotches and blights to contend with as well. The long growing season of fruit trees made them vulnerable to successive attacks. Citizens across the Transcendent State debated whether or not Chairman Winter had introduced insect evil and fungal disease into his new Garden of Eden on purpose. The question had never been settled. But at hortischool, Cape learned about neem spray, extracted from the chinaberry tree, and the organic insecticide pyrethrum, which was made from dried daisies. And he heard about an amazing cider apple called Huang’s Nectar, a disease-resistant early bloomer, well-suited to the climate of Southeast but not yet proven hardy in the north. As much to spite his father as to test the new variety, he had drained his savings and bought a dozen saplings on w4 semi-dwarfing rootstock. He started his own orchard on land he had cleared near his hut. Two years later, he brought in his first—admittedly light—harvest, which nevertheless yielded the sweetest cider and smoothest applejack anyone in Littleton had ever tasted. Cape purchased a handscrew press in his third year and switched from fermenting his cider in glass carboys to huge oak barrels by his fifth. And he bought more apple trees—he never seemed to have enough: McIntosh, GoRed, Jay’s Pippin, Alumar Gold, Adam and Eve. Soon he began to grow rootstock and sell trees to other farmers. By the time Cape married Spur’s mother, the Leungs were renting land from farmsteads on either side of their original holding.</td>

He turned in a complete circle, all senses heightened, trying to pinpoint the source. After fire ran through the litter of leaves and twigs that covered the forest floor, it often sank into the duff, the layer of decomposing organic matter that lay just above the soil level. Since duff was like a sponge, most of the year it was too wet to burn. But in the heat of summer it could dry out and became tinder. Spur had seen a smoldering fire burrow through the layer of duff and emerge dozens of meters away. He sniffed, following his nose to a charred stump. “Prosper!” said Ngonda. “What are you doing?” Spur heard a soft hiss as he crouched beside the stump. It wasn’t any fire sound that he knew, but he instinctively ran his bare hand across the stump, feeling for hotspots. Something cool and wet sprayed onto his fingers and he jerked them back as if he had been burned. He rubbed a smutty liquid between thumb and forefinger and then smelled it. It had an evil, manmade odor of extinguished fire. Spur sat back on his heels, puzzled. Why would anyone want to mimic that particular stink? Then he realized that his hand was clean when it ought to have been smudged with soot from the stump. He rubbed hard against the burned wood, but the black refused to come off.

It’s over.” “It seems like it, always, but it never happens to those things that have life in them. The Project was here before I came. It will be here after I leave. It must be longer lived than any of us, because we are for the years and it is for the centuries.” After Sonnenborn, MacDonald told Lily wearily, “No more, Lily.” None of them had had the courage to mention Maria, but MacDonald considered that failure, too.

In high school he had been a whiz at science and as a college freshman he had picked up a tattered paperback copy of George Gamow’s Thirty Years That Shook Physics and that book led to his becoming a physicist. He liked the informal style of the writing, and he was intrigued by Gamow’s drawings and most especially by his photographs—snapshots of Niels Bohr and his wife roaring off on a motorcycle, Werner Heisenberg taking a swim, a bare-chested Enrico Fermi swatting at a tennis ball, and Gamow himself with Wolfgang Pauli on a Swiss lake steamboat. Those people knew each other, got drunk together, sang songs and together developed quantum mechanics; he wanted to be part of that, wanted to join them.</td>

Not at all like fan-oriented conventions, the Milford Conferences were pro only, with both established writers and newer ones. Those present represented a significant fraction of the working SF/fantasy fields at the time, arguably the cream of the stfnal (scientifictional) crop: the three principals, of course, and Katherine McLean, Algis Budrys, Arthur Clarke, Anthony Boucher, Cyril Kornbluth, Theodore Sturgeon, Fritz Leiber, Lester and Evelyn del Rey, Robert Silverberg, and Harlan Ellison all attending in the early days, exchanging ideas and criticizing each other’s work. Kate Wilhelm, not yet then married to Knight, describes it as being “a meeting of peers, no chiefs [or] Indians, just writers critiquing one another’s stories. It never changed that format. Critiques early in the day, dinner, then discussions on set topics in the late hours.” In fact, it’s not too much of a stretch to say that, whereas the process of elevating SF (aka the “New Wave”) to a supposed level of capital-L </td>

A person can maintain control over his or her life and have a heart attack in the process, due to the anxiety and stress that accompany the effort to control the events of the outside world.<br/> “Holding dominion over” refers to our capacity to maintain the controlling influence in terms of the flow of our own lives, even if the flow includes compromise or altering our plans. Holding dominion does not mean always getting one’s own way.

Each table was cocooned with wooden panels and thick curtains, lending a lulling sense of privacy. I’d once had lunch there with a magazine editor I wanted to work with, but by the time the check arrived I had divulged so many details about my personal life—stories I rarely told anyone—that I was too embarrassed to ever face him again. In retrospect, I blamed the space itself.</td>

There were fifteen photographs in the series, three from each of the restaurants she targeted. Ginny arranged them evenly across the viewing table, spacing them precisely, as if it were a proper installation. We looked down at them for a while, quiet, casting our eyes across the three-frame story as it repeated in different settings, with different men, and different expressions of disgust.<br/> At the time of this interview, I’d just read about the 1975 famine in the Southern Territory, which had been covered only by the smaller newspapers, for reasons I do not understand. When the South seceded in 1945, all environmental regulations had been lifted on the biblical grounds of men having “dominion over the earth,” but by the mid-1970s three decades of an unbroken hunting season and heedless pollution had nearly eradicated wild game and forage. Drought, crop failure, and a strict trade embargo meant the families who best survived those years had ways of catching the rats, squirrels, and feral cats. But X never responded to the critique that her work seemed to be apolitical for never directly referencing the country’s division; nearly every other successful artist in the Northern Territory at the time seemed obliged at some point to make work as a statement about the wall, and the fact that X never did so was often cited as evidence of her heartlessness and frivolity.</td>

<td>It seemed that names had been given to and taken from me all my life, for reasons beyond my control. My parents had been in disagreement about what to write on my birth certificate, one of them insisting on Charlotte Marie and the other on Cynthia Malone. Until the age of seven I was called both names interchangeably, and when asked as a child what my name was, I gave both in a row: Charlotte Marie Lucca and Cynthia Malone Lucca. A few times this resulted in someone calling me Ann after they’d misheard the “and,” so for a year at Girl Scouts I was Ann. What’s more—my last name is my mother’s pure invention, her attempt to get away from her own family, whose last name I have never known, but my father won the first-name argument in the end, and Charlotte Marie was made my legal name, though my mother still called me Cindy and both my brothers called me Malone, Mally, or Loner. Since there were too many Charlottes in my third-grade class, a teacher started calling me Marie and that stuck for a while and I didn’t mind. In college I was Charlotte again, by default of roll call, but some people in journalism school called me Lucca—as most of us had adopted the newsroom affectation of calling people by their surnames. When I began publishing I used C. M. Lucca, and though I’d only intended for “C. M.” to appear in print, most of my colleagues started calling me C. M. Henry had the bizarre habit of calling me Char, which wasn’t a name at all but something you do to a piece of dead flesh, but I accepted this name, too, for no reason other than I had no preferred alternative. X didn’t call me anything at first, or if she did I don’t remember what she called me—“Henry Surner’s wife,” perhaps, as a joke—so when Ginny began to call me C and X followed suit, it ultimately felt fine, as it seems I was born under a nameless moon and perhaps that namelessness was what X had been drawn to from the start: I was a house without a foundation.</td>

Of course, I always had my boys memorize photographs of the major critics and curators, but this was truly hilarious, I thought—how was this kid to know, by sight alone, whether someone was important? I can’t say why I even entertained the notion, but I went out to the gallery and there she was, wearing this loose silk dress that went to the floor, some kind of circular pattern, but it was the way she was looking at the work—with a complete viciousness. I don’t know how else to explain it, as if it would be dangerous for her to look at you.<br/> “Was she enjoying the paintings, I asked, and she said, ‘Oh, no, not at all.’ She didn’t even turn to see where the question had come from. I asked if she was a collector, or an artist herself, or…? But she didn’t answer, just paced around … Eventually, she asked if I was the one to blame for these paintings. I told her that I was indeed the gallerist here, and she turned to me for the first time and said, ‘I’m so sorry to hear that,’ then launched into this explanation about how terrible the work was, how the artist had no understanding of color or dimensionality or texture, that he was indulgent, that he had no ideas, that the paintings documented his every missed opportunity. She said—‘He didn’t put anything in the paintings because he doesn’t know how. He doesn’t know anything about art, and worse, he doesn’t care.’ Now, of course I was accustomed to criticism—I even welcomed it on occasion—but no one’s opinion ever made me as doubtful as hers. Ah! Then she said this one thing I’ve thought of many times since—‘You have to know what you’re leaving out in order for it not to be there. Otherwise, it’s not an absence, it’s just nothing.’ And immediately I had a better understanding of all those void artists back then—there were so many of them. Anyway, I sent the desk boy home early, and eventually this woman said her name was Věra, and I asked her how it was she’d come to her opinions about art. ‘Oh, they’re not opinions,</td>

It is true that in the years we lived together X never needed to consult an instruction manual, and seemed to know innately how to operate any machine—the VCR, the security system, the dishwasher. After buying an old truck, she spent a half hour speed-reading an auto mechanics textbook, and from then on she took care of all the truck’s maintenance. The few times I ever complimented or even commented upon the speed with which X could absorb a new skill, she insisted—not out of humility, but in frustration—that there was nothing to it.

<td><br/> Ginny forgets everyone’s name, X explained. I knew this was a lie, as I’d seen her practically sing the names of those whose attention or money she needed—but I excused it. X and Ginny depended on each other to a degree that I knew better than to disturb, though I also knew that X recognized Ginny’s cynicism as clearly as I did. My wife and I despised a sizable percentage of the art Ginny displayed and sold at Quarry, though of course X attended every opening Ginny asked her to attend, and would fawn over the artist if Ginny nudged her to do so. X forgave anything Ginny had to do to keep her gallery dominant, a position from which they both benefited.</td>

<td>“I think everybody reaches a point when there’s no way forward,” he said, “and most people just stop right there. They stop right there and they don’t change anything about their lives. Maybe they even start to believe the limits around their life, start to think it’s all part of a plan. I must have reached this point some years ago and I didn’t do anything—maybe I couldn’t do anything—but when the wall came down and everybody else was terrified, I wasn’t worried. Wasn’t worried at all. Then I realized all those people were scared because they didn’t want their lives to change, but I did, and I still do. There’s nothing keeping me here—no wife, no kids, nothing—and I never did belong. Maybe I’m like Clara in that way, just different, and if they put men in asylums I’d probably be in one, and when you left that afternoon, well, I felt like I should go wherever you were going.”<br/> He paused here for a moment</td>

<td>In 2013, several researchers asked people to rate paintings by cubist artists, a group that includes Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Fernand Léger. First the researchers recorded people’s reactions to the paintings alone; they weren’t very good. But then the scientists included clues to the paintings’ meaning, or brief histories of the painters themselves. With these clues, audience ratings improved dramatically; suddenly, the abstract paintings were not like the inscrutable backs of strangers, but rather like a new friend, reaching out to take their hand. “The creation of meaning itself is what’s rewarding,” researcher Claudia Muth told me. “An artwork doesn’t have to be ‘easy’ to appeal to its audience.” People like a challenge if they think they can solve it. She calls this moment where disfluency yields to fluency the aesthetic aha.<br/></td>

<td>To know if a show will be a hit, NBC administers a series of national surveys. If 40 percent of respondents say they are aware of a new show, and 40 percent of that 40 percent say they want to watch it, and 20 percent of that 16 percent say they are passionate about the new show, NBC can confidently predict that the program will be a hit. This is the 40-40-20 test, and it works. One of the last shows to pass this threshold, The Blacklist, debuted on NBC as one of the ten most popular shows on television.</td>

<td>So the answer to the question “What do people want to read?” has three dimensions. The first dimension is the simplest to observe: It’s clicks, likes, and shares. It’s everything you can learn from just watching people, like George Gallup in an Iowan’s living room. The second dimension is closer to vicarious goal fulfillment. It’s what people ask for in surveys—hard news on the News Feed, salad on the menu—but doesn’t always show up in their observed behavior. The third dimension is the most complex and, perhaps, the most valuable. It’s what people don’t know they want, but if you give it to them, it will make their lives better, sometimes through sheer surprise, like the iPhone, and sometimes through unexpected network effects, like friending stories on Facebook.<br/></td>

Martin book with copious annotations.<br/>			 Lombardo approached Weiss to say hello. They chatted for a few minutes. “He was holding a highlighter in his hands,” Lombardo told me, “and the book was absolutely covered in notes and dog-ears. That’s what HBO wants, to bet on that sort of commitment and passion”—the sort that inspires an obsessive-compulsive approach to adapting a fantasy epic for a network that doesn’t do fantasy. “Whatever reservations I had, they were gone. I thought, ‘These guys aren’t swinging for the easy hit. They’re doing this because they love these stories.’” In January 2007, Lombardo and HBO optioned the series. Eight years later, Game of Thrones knocked off The Sopranos to become HBO’s most watched show of all time.</td>

First, the Swedish government actively promotes public music education at a time when many countries have no such policy (“I have public music education to thank for everything,” Martin said in 2001).

With fresh tears streaming down her face, she removed Lily’s bright green sneakers one at a time, then grabbed the bowl of sand and placed Lily’s bare feet into it. Allison lovingly grabbed Lily’s hand and stroked her fingers, repeating over and over, “You made it, Lil. You made it to the beach. I love you. You made it.” I watched as one tear fell down Lily’s cheek and onto her T-shirt. Allison cried harder.<br/>			 Then, as if the universe knew, the wind stopped along with Lily’s breath.

But was that really necessary? Was there any reason Chris and I couldn’t plan a wedding in the next couple of months? I imagined what our wedding would be like if I didn’t spend a year planning it. I might not get my first-choice wedding venue. Some people might not be able to make it. I might not be able to find my dream dress. But none of those things even came close to the sadness we would all feel if Babette wasn’t there on our wedding day.

<td>I groggily hauled myself out of bed a couple of hours later. I could hear Brody playing in the next room. I still had that strange feeling like I wasn’t alone. I walked into the kitchen to pour myself some coffee. “I feel like I’m not alone even when I’m alone,” I told Chris. “Do you ever feel like that?”<br/>			 “Oh yeah, not often, but I definitely know what you’re talking about.”<br/>			 “Maybe I’m just tired,” I said as I walked toward the bedroom to start getting ready for the day. I pulled out clean scrubs from our dresser and put them on, then balled up my pajamas and threw them into the hamper. They landed on top of my dirty scrubs from a few hours ago, and I realized that I hadn’t removed my name tag. As I rifled through the hamper, I suddenly felt a gush of wind on the back of my neck. I froze. Too scared to look in the direction of the wind, I waited a moment and then opened up our bedroom door and yelled to Chris, “Hey, does the AC ever just randomly blow air?”<br/>			 “Uh, yeah, when it kicks on. Why?” he yelled back.<br/>			 “Oh, never mind. I’m just being silly, then. Thanks.” I shut the door again and laughed at myself. I put on my makeup and threw my dirty hair into a bun. After getting Brody dressed, I hoisted him up onto my hip and walked to the car. I felt like I was forgetting something, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. After dropping him off at school, I suddenly realized that I hadn’t taken my name tag off my dirty scrubs. Groaning, I turned back around, knowing I’d be late for the morning meeting, but also knowing that Travis would make me go back home to get it anyway. Dashing inside and ripping the name tag off my scrubs, I glanced at my watch and felt relieved when I realized I’d only be a minute or two late.<br/>			 As I drove toward the office, the cars in front of me came to a sudden halt. “Ugh!” I groaned aloud in frustration. “Now I’m really going to be late.” A few minutes later, the line of cars started to slowly roll forward. After about a mile, I realized what the holdup was: A truck had slammed into the back of another truck. My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the damage, which was severe, but would have been much worse if the car that had been hit wasn’t so sturdy. That could have been me and it could have killed me, I thought. Thankfully, it looked like all parties were out of their cars and walking around. Suddenly, I was grateful to have forgotten my name tag.</td>

Some veteran nurses rolled their eyes when interns like me were assigned to shadow them. Others showed even more obvious signs of annoyance, loudly saying things like “Why do they always put the students with me?

My therapist and I talked a lot about this too. For so long—even dating back to my earliest days in the ER—I had functioned from a place of sympathy. I put myself in my patient’s or their caregiver’s shoes; I put myself in the shoes of people like Will. I felt their pain, I felt their loss, and it affected me deeply. To be honest, I think this ability to feel what other people are feeling is part of what makes me a good nurse, and especially a good hospice nurse. But it also takes a personal toll, and I’m sure it’s one of the reasons why nurses experience so many mental health challenges and don’t last for long in the field. In fact, only one out of every four hospice nurses makes it beyond five years, from what I’ve heard.<br/>			 Empathy, on the other hand, is the ability to feel for a person and their situation without being personally affected by it. Empathy allows me to be present and compassionate without taking on a situation as my own, and it has allowed me to continue being a good nurse without burning out or engaging in the dark humor that so many people in my profession do, for their own sanity. It has allowed me to be a witness to one of the most important moments in a person and their loved ones’ </td>

She has committed no crime, she has merely broken a rigid and time-honored code of our society, a code so severe that whoever breaks it is hounded from our midst as unfit to live with. She is the victim of cruel poverty and ignorance, but I cannot pity her: she is white. She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, as her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something every child has done—she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her. But in this case she was no child hiding stolen contraband: she struck out at her victim—of necessity she must put him away from her—he must be removed from her presence, from this world. She must destroy the evidence of her offense.<br/><br/>   “What was the evidence of her offense? Tom Robinson, a human being. She must put Tom Robinson away from her. Tom Robinson was her daily reminder of what she did. What did she do? She tempted a Negro.<br/><br/>   “She was white, and she tempted a Negro.

A tip or a promise was enough to devalue fruit of one grower, and boost the price of another’s … So those noble fruits … were in the hands of greedy speculators who did not recognize anything but their own profit, obtained by any means, by any sacrifice of their fellow countrymen.</td>

There’s a citrus-related task for virtually every month of the year in Ibn al-Awam’s book, but if a tree fails to respond to this intensive level of care there is also a simple cure. ‘Let two men carrying an axe approach the tree,’ he advises, ‘and let the one say, “This tree will be cut down”, at which the other should plead for it … Then the first must say, “But it bears no fruit”, to which the other shall reply, “It will do so this year, and if it does not, then you will be free to do as you please.”’1 That generally did the trick, according to Ibn al-Awam, and he was obviously right.</td>

This sudden transformation was due to a natural genetic instability, something that is common in cultivated citrus due to their hybrid origin and to propagation by cuttings, which can result in their shoots containing a mixture of genetically distinct cells. At a time when diet was still strictly controlled by the seasons, the significance of the trees’ late-ripening fruit is almost impossible to overestimate.<br/></td>

<td>By cross-referencing with other instances of erysipelas, Coley found more evidence of patients recovering unexpectedly from cancer after falling ill with a fever and infection after undergoing surgery to remove a cancerous tumor. He noticed that other medical pioneers such as Louis Pasteur had reported similar findings with erysipelas and began to suspect that postsurgical infections in some cases actually helped patients recover from cancer. Coley hypothesized that the infections triggered an immune response that not only ridded the body of the invading bacteria, as a fever is intended to do, but also stimulated the body’s immune system to attack the cancer cells.<br/> Coley immediately tested his theory on a cancer patient on whom all other treatments had failed, injecting him directly with live streptococcus bacteria. The man, who had a tumor the size of a chicken egg on his neck, could barely speak or swallow and had been given only weeks to live. After the injection, his fever flared and he grew alarmingly ill. But then, as he recovered from the infection, he and Coley watched the tumor dissolve and disappear. The man survived and went home cancer-free.<br/> The implications were astounding—somehow, the body’s natural processes of fighting infection were also breaking down cancerous tumors, liquefying and flushing them away as if they’d never been there.<br/> Rereading the story of Dr. Coley and Bessie Dashiell, I was struck by the visionary nature of his discoveries, so long ago. Coley, now called “the father of immunotherapy,” uncovered something essential about the power of the human immune system—a way to potentially turn it on to fight an incurable illness. He went on to develop a mixture of dead bacteria that he began to use as a cancer treatment, safer to use since this mixture was less likely to make sick people sicker to the point of death. But the idea of introducing “bad” bacteria into the body was difficult for people to accept.<br/></td>

But the medical world couldn’t, or wouldn’t, accept the theory that diseases were spread in this way. First of all, the notion that doctors carried some kind of infectious substance on their hands was laughed off as utter nonsense—to think there were tiny, invisible creatures covering surfaces and flying through the air spreading illness seemed absurd. And second, the idea that doctors had been responsible for their patients’ suffering and death all along was impossible to believe, anathema to the image of physicians as saviors. “Doctors are gentlemen,” said one prominent Philadelphia physician, “and a gentleman’s hands are clean.”<br/> Semmelweis was mocked and threatened and eventually run out of the medical profession entirely. He reportedly took to stopping pregnant women in the street and urging them to “make sure your doctor washes his hands.” Judged insane, he was committed to a psychiatric institution, where he died—quite possibly of the very same strain of sepsis that had once killed so many of his female patients.</td>

<td>Once kea have learned how to solve a problem or use a gadget, they don’t forget. Schwing brings out a wooden box he used in an elaborate experiment some years earlier to test the kea’s cognitive skills and ability to cooperate. The wooden box is raised on legs and bottomed by a tray that drops down if properly triggered. In the experiment, the tray was loaded with treats—parrot pellets stuck there with cream cheese. Attached to the tray were four separate chains threaded through holes in the side of the box. To release the tray and access the treats, four kea had to pull the different chains simultaneously—and continue to pull together until the tray released. If only one bird pulled at a time, the chain would slide out without moving the tray. If any of the birds lets go too soon, the tray would pop back up out of reach.<br/>			 The results were impressive. Kermit led the way, and after a little training, the other kea quickly learned to pull together—and to persist—so they could all get their treats.<br/>			 A couple of years later, a film and photography crew from the National Geographic Society wanted to take photos of the kea cooperatively solving the wooden box and strings puzzle. “I didn’t have high hopes,” Schwing recalls. The kea hadn’t seen the puzzle box in over a year. But he took what he thought were his four best birds and put them in a waiting compartment while the crews set up the cameras.<br/>			 “It was breeding season, so there was some tension—they were chasing each other around in there,” he says. “And I thought, ‘Oh, this is not looking good.’ But the moment I opened the gate for them to get access to the box, they fell in line, one after another, not even a body length in distance between beak and tail. And in this group of four they walked right over to the box, past the photographers, past the lights, past everything, walked right up and found their places and pulled on the chains.<br/>			 “We did this several times so the camera crew could get all their shots. The photographer ended up lying down with his head so close to one kea that he was blocking access to the chain. The bird walked over and just pushed the photographer’s head aside with his foot so he could get to the chain and pull on it.</td>

At the other end of the spectrum are the champions of extra-pair sex, Australian magpies and fairy-wrens. The mismatch between the fairy-wrens’ social mating system—the birds form lifelong pair-bonds—and their sexual mating system is nothing short of spectacular.

Suzuki found evidence that Japanese tit alarm calls create just this kind of search image in the heads of listening birds.

<td>	 If a cuckoo parasitizes a host species, the host will evolve the ability to reject the foreign eggs. This was the accepted wisdom when Naomi Langmore of Australian National University started working on cuckoos in Australia in the early 2000s. But the more field studies she looked at, the more evidence she found against this. In fact, most Australian host species tended not to reject cuckoo eggs. “Which is completely counter to evolutionary theory,” she says. “The arms race between them should exert powerful pressure on the host both to recognize foreign eggs and to reject them.”<br/>			 Were the host birds down under really incapable of distinguishing between their own eggs and a cuckoo’s?<br/>			 To find out, Langmore made a slew of little plastic eggs that were bright blue—different from the egg color of any host species in Australia—and placed them in the nests of a lot of different host species. She found that host birds that built cup-shaped nests could easily recognize and reject those plastic eggs. But birds that built dome-shaped nests, such as fairy-wrens, could not. This makes sense: Dome nests are dark places where it’s tough to make visual distinctions.<br/>			 Then Langmore made the sort of discovery that shocks scientists and makes research on this weird system of parenting so rewarding. When she looked more closely at birds that build these dome nests, primarily fairy-wrens and thornbills, she found to her amazement that although they couldn’t reject cuckoo eggs, they had a very fine ability to recognize cuckoo chicks—and reject them. The little host birds would either seize the intruding chick and drag it out of the nest or abandon the nest altogether to start a new breeding attempt.</td>

Predators are a big problem for these birds. During their first winter of life, more than a third are taken by owls, pine martens, sparrowhawks, and especially goshawks, which account for 70 percent of all kills. Goshawks hunt in three phases—perching in a tree and scanning for prey, making search flights to the next perch, where they scan some more, and then, finally, bulleting through the brush to take their prey by surprise. The jays have evolved a sophisticated system of three different alarm calls specifying the hunting phase of the hawk—whether it’s perched, searching for prey, or attacking.<br/></td>

He sat down next to the aviary for the ravens, birds he had hand-raised himself or worked with closely, so they knew him well. They expected good things from him and came over to see what he was doing. He pulled out his bike light, and the instant he turned it on, the birds fled. Then he went over to the kea aviary.

He was instantly cluttered with a chaos of kea.<br/>			 This dichotomy affects how the different labs at Haidlhof train students to work with the two birds, says Schwing. With the ravens, students are asked to stand outside the aviary for something like two to three weeks to give the ravens a chance to get to know them before they’re allowed to interact with the birds in any way. “With kea, we do the opposite,” says Schwing: “We train our students by sending them into the aviary with the caretakers to help with the cleaning, so the kea get to know them in a routine setting. Because once we start testing, we don’t want the students to be so novel and interesting to the kea that they ignore what they’re supposed to be doing and just go play with this new person they’ve never seen before,” he says.<br/></td>

<td>One lyrebird in Dalziell’s study area wins a lot of matings. She calls him Triple Blue and he sings especially beautifully, “a truly astounding free-flowing improvisation full of loud, flamboyant mimicry,” she says. “For lyrebirds, the evidence is strong that mimicry in males is sexually selected.” Belting out mimicry to females he can’t see is a male’s way of advertising himself, saying, “Look how clever I am, how accurate and versatile my mimicry is, how strong is my voice. I’m very intelligent (the accuracy of my mimicry shows that I have a good brain), and I can sing for hours a day.” As Dalziell points out, the female alone sees to all the parental care—building the nest, brooding and raising the chick, defending her feeding territory. All she needs from a male is sperm. A choosy female measures a prospective mate by his spectacular plumage, his dancing ability, and his loud, complex, flamboyant song, including the versatility and accuracy of his mimicry and the carrying capacity of his calls. All of these traits may act as “honest” signals of a male’s quality—his ability to learn, his strength and vigor, his genes, the conditions in which he was raised. “It’s probably good for females to mate with males that are proficient vocal mimics so that their offspring are also competent at using mimicry to defend nests if they’re female and to obtain mates if they’re male,” says Dalziell. A female will listen to various males for months and months before she settles on a mate. Only the best performers get to pass on their genes. Hence, a smart, high-performing bird species gets smarter, better at mimicking, at dancing, and at growing gorgeous tail feathers.</td>

<td>Birds top us in color vision, too. They see hues beyond our imagining. Humans have three types of color-receptive cones in our retinas, blue, green, and red. Birds have a fourth color cone that is sensitive to ultraviolet wavelengths. We are thus “trichromatic,” and most diurnal birds are “tetrachromatic.” With their extra UV cone, birds can distinguish shades of color we can’t tell apart, allowing them to spot prey well camouflaged against the uniform background of a grassy field or leafy forest floor, and to detect things invisible to us—like the trail of urine left by a vole.<br/>			 But it goes beyond this. Birds see a massive spectrum of color our brains are simply incapable of processing. “It’s not just that they can see wavelengths of colors in a part of the spectrum we can’t see,” says Mary Caswell Stoddard, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Princeton University, who studies avian color vision. “It’s that ultraviolet light is a fundamental part of many of the colors they perceive. They’re experiencing another whole dimension of color—all the colors we can see, with varied amounts of UV mixed in. So it’s not simply human vision plus some purplish UV colors. It’s a complete reimagining of the color experience.”<br/>			 While there’s no way to know what a color actually looks like to birds, Stoddard can measure with a spectrophotometer the wavelengths of light reflected by an object or a surface. This tells her whether or not a color is reflecting ultraviolet light. Then she can estimate its appearance in a way that’s relevant to bird vision using a computer program called TetraColorSpace that she developed with ornithologist</td>

Osvath and a graduate student, Can Kabadayi, taught five ravens how to use a special tool—a stone of a specific weight and shape—to open a puzzle-like box containing a high-value treat. Though ravens are not tool users by nature, the birds were quick studies, requiring only one lesson to learn the trick—“a single observation of tool use by a non-tool-using species!” Osvath exclaims. When the experimenters took the box away and presented the ravens with a choice of objects, only one of which was the functional tool that could open the box, the birds picked the object that would be most useful to them if that treat-laden puzzle box reappeared in the future. They could wait as long as seventeen hours and would do so even when they were offered an inferior treat immediately; despite the temptation, the birds didn’t bite on the lesser alternative.

If our species disappears and corvids lose this resource, there may be selective pressure among them to boost cognition, says Osvath.

Cooler temperatures, calmer air, less ambient noise from insects (and traffic), allow a bird’s song to travel farther, the better to stake its territory—at least in northern species—or to broadcast its presence to prospective mates. Or maybe it’s that predators are less of a threat.

As such, they perform a vital, and vastly underrated, service to the environment: the quick, competent cleanup and recycling of dead creatures.<br/>			 Vultures are nature’s sanitary workers. Because they feed in groups and eat rapidly—each bird downing more than two pounds of meat a minute—they can rapidly consume whole carcasses.

That’s not the case with more leisurely mammalian carrion eaters such as rats or dogs or coyotes.<br/>			 What happens when vultures vanish, people learned the hard way in India and Pakistan more than a decade ago.

Male care for these species is of limited value, says Cockburn, “allowing females to choose freely among males for good genes rather than for direct benefits from the male such as a high-quality territory or paternal provisioning.” Many of these are bird species that lek, such as hummingbirds, manakins, bowerbirds, and lyrebirds. The female picks a mate from the crowd and then goes off to raise her brood on her own.<br/></td>

The eastern whipbird, a slender olive-colored bird with a white cheek patch and a cute little black crest, throws its whole body behind its voice. And what a voice. The whipbird’s dramatic call is considered such a signature sound of the rainforest that it’s used in movies for jungle scenes. The distinctive and enchanting two-note “whipcrack” call, a kind of thin whistled whoooopp capped by a sudden, loud chew, chew! is actually a duet, male and female singing in a call-and-response so precisely timed and seamlessly delivered it sounds like one bird calling. The male initiates the call, and the female responds within a fraction of a millisecond.</td>

To seabirds, it’s the scent of sustenance. “Birds tend to be attracted not to prey scents per se,” she says, “but rather to odors such as DMS that are released during feeding interactions”—a euphemistic term for the ravaging of prey by predators. In other words, says Nevitt, “predators tend to be messy eaters, and tube-nosed seabirds have adapted to pay attention to who is eating whom.”<br/>			 A sensitivity to DMS also explains why seabirds consume plastics and other trash. Plastic debris emits the chemical scent, making trash smell like food and creating a kind of olfactory booby trap for seabirds.</td>

With the help of special filters, the camera simulates the full visual spectrum of birds. One major discovery: To birds, the dense foliage of a rainforest likely looks not like the uniform, largely flat mass of green we see, but a detailed three-dimensional world of highly contrasting individual leaves. I have tried to see this way, to pick out distinct leaves amid the wall of green, but contrasts in green are hard for humans to distinguish—which is what makes the green catbird in the rainforest so impossible to spot. UV light amplifies the contrast between the tops of leaf surfaces and their undersides, so the three-dimensional structure—the position and orientation—of the leaves pop out. This makes it easier for birds to navigate through complex leafy environments and to find food there.<br/>			 Color, beauty, reality truly do lie in the eye of the beholder.<br/></td>

<td>Here’s where duetting comes in. The temperate regions such as North America and Europe, where duetting is rare, and female song in general is less common, are the regions that host a lot of migrants. “It’s the migratory birds that have lost female song,” explains Langmore, who was part of the study. “Migrants have a very different pattern of territoriality and pairing than in the tropics. Typically, the male will arrive on the breeding grounds singing his head off, and the females will fly in and listen, and they’ll plunk down on the chosen male’s territory. Then they’ll have a very short breeding season. They just go for it like crazy, and then they leave.”<br/>			 Resident birds, on the other hand, like those in the tropics, have to defend their territory all year long. If, over the years, a partner dies, the remaining bird has to be able to defend that territory and attract a new mate. “And there can be divorce, as well,” says Langmore. “Whichever bird is left has to be able to sing to defend its territory or attract a new mate. So it seems like it’s quite a recent thing that females have lost song in these migratory groups.”</td>

Some of the kea at Messerli use the whistle call with Schwing, but in the wild, it’s extremely rare. Out of nearly twenty-five thousand calls he recorded, only twenty-four were this whistle. Schwing believes it’s a very personal communication between one bird and another that seems to say, “I want to have close contact.” A video he took of the whistle call shows a male perched on a bench. A female lands and moves toward him to preen him, but he kicks her away. She jumps back and then whistles quietly. He immediately lowers his head and allows her to come in and preen him. “We have birds in the aviary who can be quite rambunctious and bite hard,” says Schwing, “but when another bird gives the whistle, they become very gentle.” Schwing suspects these vocalizations are actually externalizations of the birds’ internal emotional state.</td>

This crow makes and keeps its own highly sophisticated tools. It’s the only species other than humans to make and use hook tools, little sticks with a hook on the end, which the bird uses to extract grubs and other invertebrates from tree holes and the nooks and crannies of plants. The crows also make very elaborate hooked tools from the leaves of pandanus trees. Pandanus leaves have little barbs along the edge, which the bird uses to latch onto its grubs. It takes a lot of complicated steps to make these tools. The birds make several methodical cuts and tears in the leaf before removing the fully crafted tool from the leaf. This suggests they have an image of the tool in their heads before they actually start making it.<br/>			 In 2018, the New Caledonian crow showed us that a bird can create tools by combining two or more elements—a feat so far seen only in humans and great apes. For the experiment, researchers caught eight crows in the wild of New Caledonia and brought them to a research station at Oxford University. They presented the crows with a puzzle box the birds had never seen before, which held a small food container behind a door with a narrow open slot along the bottom. They gave the crows long sticks, which the birds promptly inserted through the slot and used to push the food out through a window in the side of the box. Then the scientists gave the crows stick pieces too short to reach the food—some hollow and some solid, with different diameters so that they could fit inside one another.<br/>			 With no training or guidance, four of the crows put together the pieces within five minutes and used the longer compound pole to reach and extract the food.

The engineers had figured out that if they introduced ethyl mercaptan into the line, they could locate leaks by the concentrations of turkey vultures circling above the line or sitting on the ground next to it. The same sulfurous chemical added to natural gas so the human nose can detect a leak, it turns out, is also released by an animal shortly after it dies.

Another house wren filled a birdhouse with nesting material but then could not find a mate, so he fed three black-headed grosbeaks with caterpillars and other foods until they fledged. As if that wasn’t enough, he then fed a family of nestling house sparrows. When a brood of eastern kingbirds were orphaned after an electrical storm, an eastern wood pewee fed the foundlings for ten days until they fledged.

<td>Budgies and other birds learn their songs and calls through a process very similar to the way we learn to speak. It’s a process of imitating and practicing called vocal learning, and it’s extremely rare in the animal world. Vocal learning in birds begins early, just as it does in humans. By the last trimester of pregnancy, a human fetus can memorize what it hears from the external world and is especially sensitive to melody in both music and language. This appears to be true for some birds, too. The embryos of certain species can hear through the shell of the egg; in response to the voice of a parent, their heart rate increases. As a defense against brood parasites, superb fairy-wrens learn special vocal passwords from their parents when they’re still in the egg. Scientists have found that at least five days before they hatch, the unborn fairy-wren chicks learn to imitate the call. Zebra finch parents can tell their young while they’re still developing in the egg that it’s hot outside. This is vital information for a growing chick. In hot climates, birds need to be able to lose heat, which is easier with a smaller body. When zebra finch parents are breeding in a hot climate, and the nest hits a temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit, they’ll chirp the news to their unborn chicks in the last third of the incubation period—the moment when the embryos are developing their temperature-regulation system. In response to these “hot calls,” the chicks will actually curtail their growth and emerge smaller—an adaptive advantage in the heat.<br/></td>

Moreover, if kites and falcons have learned to manipulate fire to flush out prey, this would be the first known use of fire as a tool by any nonhuman animal, overturning some old entrenched assumptions—the orthodoxy that only humans spread fire, and that our singular mastery of fire was largely what made us masters over the environment.

<td>In fact, play is most often defined by what it is not: It is behavior that is not purposeful, serves no obvious adaptive function, does nothing to enhance an animal’s chance of survival and reproduction—nothing apparent, at least.<br/>			 Not long ago, Gordon Burghardt, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, took on the problem of crafting a more positive definition of play and came up with a set of five criteria for recognizing play in any species. First, it’s behavior that’s not fully functional, although it may resemble behavior that’s useful in another context. For instance, a puppy thrashing a toy mimics a wolf’s takedown of prey, but the puppy doesn’t end up eating the toy (well, not usually, although my pitbull-lab mix has been known to). Play is exaggerated, awkward, and repetitive—like all those excessive flourishes in flight of the ravens on Santa Cruz Island—and often inappropriate. It’s also spontaneous, voluntary, intentional, pleasurable, and rewarding. It’s only initiated when an animal is adequately fed, healthy, and not under stress. In sum, says Burghardt, “Play is repeated, seemingly non-functional behavior different from more adaptive versions . . . and initiated when the animal is in a relaxed, unstimulating or low stress setting.” In other words, it’s a kind of behavioral frill—but far from a frivolous one.</td>

<td>Evolutionary ecologist Andrew Cockburn has been studying superb fairy-wrens at the Australian National Botanic Gardens since 1987. He has a long history of working in weird mating systems. He began his career investigating Antechinus, a group of small, mouse-like marsupials that exhibit the strange phenomenon of semelparity. Soon after mating, males die. But after years studying the bizarre mammals, he says, he realized that he “was not having nearly as much fun tramping through leech-infested rainforest as one of [his] graduate students was having teasing apart the intricate sex lives of superb fairy-wrens in the croissant-infested Botanic Gardens in Canberra.</td>

<td> you think about where owls are hunting, the natural conditions they face, the Blakiston’s reliance on vision and the great gray owl’s reliance on hearing make sense, says Jonathan Slaght. Great gray owls hunt where it’s flat, with snow and quiet. Fish owls regularly hunt in narrow river valleys, with shallow, fast-flowing, and rocky waterways. “If a fish owl had hypersensitive hearing and hunted in these waterways, it would go crazy,” he says. “It’s so loud that trying to isolate the sound of prey in that type of habitat would be impossible. The fish owl does have a facial disk, but it’s nowhere near as pronounced as that of a great gray owl or a barn owl, which can catch things in 100 percent darkness because of their heightened hearing ability.”<br/>			 For a long time, scientists thought birds smaller than owls were poorly adapted</td>

Every cormorant leaving the colony to fish joins the raft for guidance before heading for feeding grounds.<br/>			 How remarkable: Birds create an actual living compass for food finding.</td>

<td>Play occupies a big chunk of time for ravens, especially young ones. A few examples of their games: picking up twigs and flying with them, then drop-catching them in the air; hanging upside down by one foot while holding a toy or a piece of food, then switching the object from beak to foot and back again, time after time. One captive raven was observed tossing a rubber ball in the air again and again and catching it while lying on its back. A tipster in Arthur Cleveland Bent’s Life Histories of North American Jays, Crows, and Titmice watched ravens sliding down the high bank of a river on rolling pebbles and crumbling clay, a dozen at a time, croaking loudly with apparent enjoyment. “This noise was heard over a mile before we paddled up to the birds, where we stopped to witness their amusement. The trees in the vicinity contained numbers of ravens aiding the sport with their cries of approval or taking their turns as the others became tired.”<br/></td>

The little Pickwells made as much fuss over Mars Bar as over Maniac. They believed, as did all little kids in tKe West End, that he carried a hundred Mars Bars with him at all times. Not surprisingly, Mrs. Pickwell never batted an eye when she saw who was coming to dinner. It was quite a sight, all right — sixteen Pickwells plus Maniac, plus a down-and-out golf caddie — eighteen so-called white faces and Mars Bar Thompson. To his credit, Mars Bar didn’t use the words “fish-belly” or “honky” once, though on one occasion he did bend the truth a mite. When a Pickwell kid asked him if it was true about the famous race in April, did Maniac really beat him going backward? — Mars Bar studied his fork for a minute and said, “Yeah, he went backward. But you got the story wrong. Wasn’t me he beat. Was my brother, Milky Way.” The little kids couldn’t understand why the grownups laughed for five minutes after that. As for Mars Bar himself, his expression never changed until the dinner was almost over, when the littlest non-baby Pickwell, Dolly, called him “Mr. Bar.” And even then it wasn’t so much a smile as a crack in the glare. Even if Mars wasn’t letting on, Maniac could tell he was pleased to learn his fame had spread to the West. When they left, half the Pickwell kids followed them, begging Mars to perform his legendary feat of stopping traffic. “Don’t,” Maniac warned. “It might not work over here.” But the Pickwells persisted, and when they reached Marshall Street, Mars Bar commanded, “Stay here,” and stepped into the traffic. Not only did he shamble, jive, shuck, and hipdoo-dle at his own sweet pace, he did something he had never even done in the East End — he came to a complete and utter halt halfway across and let nothing but the evil in his eyes take care of the rest.

What had he thought? What had he expected? A miracle? Well, come to think of it, maybe one had happened. While he was looking for one miracle, maybe another had snuck up on him. It happened as he was clamping and lugging Mars Bar down the gauntlet of Cobras, trying to keep him alive — and what was Mars Bar doing? Fighting him, Maniac, straining to get loose and bust some Cobras. Out-numbered, out-weighed, but not out-hearted. That’s when Maniac felt it — pride, for this East End warrior whom Maniac could feel trembling in his arms, scared as any normal kid would be, but not showing it to them.

Amanda led him by the hand across the muddy, lumpy earth. “Boost me,” she commanded at the fence. He boosted her. Mars Bar helped her down from the other side.

<td>IN THE SPRING OF 2017 I flew to Austin, Texas, to cover South by Southwest for Esquire. I was sitting alone in a dark Alamo Drafthouse theater, scribbling notes about a documentary called The Work. In the film, the cameras take you inside Folsom State Prison for intensive group therapy sessions. Men convicted of crimes sit side by side with visitors from the outside who haven’t been sentenced to jail but are dealing with buried issues that are inhibiting their lives. Over the course of four days, both the incarcerated people and the free men push one another to open up about their struggles. Many participants resist. Early on, several of the men judge, scoff, and pay lip service to the whole ordeal. But eventually the dam breaks for everyone. Some of the men go into a blind rage after particular comments from group members prick their suppressed pain. They punch and writhe. Their neck veins pop. One of the visitors, Brian, emits a guttural howl that sounds like the devil is flying out of his chest. But after these bouts of explosive anger and violence come tears. Some men nearly collapse in exhaustion, having finally let this suppressed pain out of their body. In Brian’s case, his face transforms after punching and screaming and crying. It’s an epic expulsion of emotion. It takes multiple incarcerated men to restrain him. When the outburst is over, Brian’s eyes are lighter. He literally looks like a different person.<br/>			 As I sat in the theater watching all of this unfold, I started sobbing. I wept for over an hour, drenching my sleeves and notebook.</td>

<td>Somehow, Dr. Zeus invented a time transcendence field. It, too, had its limitations. Time travel is only possible backward, for one thing. You can return to your own present once you’ve finished your business in the past, but you can’t jump forward into your future. So much for finding out who’s going to win in the fifth race at Santa Anita on April 1, 2375.<br/> Still, Dr. Zeus played around with the field and discovered what could at first be taken as a comforting fact: History cannot be changed. You can’t go back and save Lincoln, but neither can you erase your own present by accidentally killing one of your ancestors. To repeat, history cannot be changed.<br/> However—and listen closely, this is the important part—this law can only be observed to apply to recorded history. See the implications?<br/> You can’t loot the future, but you can loot the past.<br/> I’ll spell it out for you. If history states that John Jones won a million dollars in the lottery on a certain day in the past, you can’t go back there and win the lottery instead. But you can make sure that John Jones is an agent of yours, who will purchase the winning ticket on that day and dutifully invest the proceeds for you. From your vantage point in the future, you tell him which investments are sound and which financial institutions are stable. Result: the longest of long-term dividends for future you.</td>

<td>Now that I come to write of what we did together, I have a peculiar reluctance to put pen to paper. Yes, this is definitely pain I feel. There is a locked door, you see, hinges red as blood with rust: it screams upon being opened and tries to close again, but through its narrow space I see the color green.<br/> Long grass where we lay, in the heart of the maze, and the little white flowers of the hedge had a sweet smell, like semen. I had filled my overskirt with damson plums, and we took turns eating them and reading to one another from De Immensa Misericordia Dei. I can still see the explosion of green at his window, the summer leaves crowding thick as though they would burst in on us where we sat naked on his bed. We had a dish of strawberries and a flagon of Rhenish wine, and he cradled a mandolin on his lap, for decency’s sake, he said; his big hands closed on the frets and plucked the strings. Sweat formed on his fair skin. He taught me songs.<br/><br/> This truly hurts. But I need to record that green filtered sunlight streaming in through the great hall, where we made eye contact over breakfast. His foot sought mine under the table. He peeled oranges for me in long curls of gold. I ate them for him in suggestive ways, eloquent with lips and tongue. God knows what the servants thought.<br/> So you may laugh at my heart’s nakedness, but I’ll tell you this much: all my nasty expectations fell away like stone birds that summer. With each sexual act and variation, layers of fear came away to reveal a commonplace, comfortable pastime.<br/> It wasn’t that the obsession died—Christ, we couldn’t keep our hands off each other. What clutchings in the maze, what passionate and explicit notes in Greek we left for each other! But it became innocent. Maybe wholesome is a better word. Pleasant and unremarkable as eating. No sense of sin. What a revelation for me, eh?<br/> We played mental games with each other, too, he still asking oblique questions about alchemists and I poking with casual remarks about weird Anabaptist sects. Stimulating discourses, as it were, to counterpoint our play.<br/></td>

I’ll go down on my knees if you but ask.

If it were controllable or predictable, the Company could make use of it; but it isn’t, so we don’t. And when you’re transforming a mortal into an immortal, you really don’t want anything uncontrollable or unpredictable in the equation, because any mistakes you make aren’t going to go away. Ever.</td>

<td><br/> Once upon a time I’d been the rabbit, hadn’t I? The rabbit who always won, who might drive the mean-spirited duck or the little pink man crazy with his tricks but who was never mean-spirited himself. That had been my favorite role for years and years, clever immortal guy outwitting brutish mortals but never doing them any harm.<br/> Gradually the world got darker and smaller, and my job got a little dirtier. So I told myself I was the man who had to go down the mean streets, though he wasn’t mean himelf. I was still the hero, even if now and then I had to hurt somebody. And if it was kind of lonely sometimes, well, that went with the job. Philip Marlowe never got the girl, did he? He always seemed to end up alone in his rented room, no company but a bottle or a chess problem, until the door should open and another desperate soul ask for his help.<br/> You really have to lie to yourself sometimes, if you’re stuck with eternal life.<br/> But there would come a point where it was just no use anymore, not with the things I had to do in my line of work, and I couldn’t seem to find the role. I was the secret good guy on the bad-guy team, right, playing the Company’s hand, not really a member of the Inquisition. But for every Jew I smuggled out of the dungeons because his genetic code was unique and the Company wanted it passed on, I had to watch as twenty were burned. Hell, I helped burn them. Being able to play the sinister Spanish devil, a good meaty part, wasn’t much compensation.<br/> I’d been playing Coyote for years now, really, hadn’t I? No hero at all, and lately not even much of a villain. God knows I did what the Company asked of me—what else could I do?—but nowadays most of my jobs seemed to consist of catching anvils with my head. How far down was I going to fall? How far before my own personal little puff of dust signaled to the chuckling gods that I’d hit bottom?<br/></td>

She did a lot of wistful talking over her nonalcoholic Chardonnay; so did her money. One thing led to another, and within two weeks the New Life Chumash Nation had placed its order with the Company. As the Company had known it would.<br/> Bring the Chumash out of the past for us, they said. Give us back our traditions, our ancient ways. We want to dress up in Chumash robes. We want the total Chumash experience. Spare no expense.<br/> And with those magic words, Dr. Zeus got to work. From their labs they got out all this Chumash genetic material that they, uh, just happened to have. They brought out all the carefully propagated flora and fauna of the Chumash ecosystem from their botanical and zoological gardens. They brought from their records every possible detail of Chumash folkways and culture, and boy, they sure had a lot of material.<br/> The sacred ground was detoxified and bulldozed back into its original contours; it was replanted; it was restocked with animal life. Cleaning and restocking the adjacent ocean floor was harder, but, you know, they’d said to spare no expense, and who was the Company to argue? There was some outcry from historical preservationists when the picturesque old oil rigs off the coast were dismantled. Cash donations shut them up. When everything had naturalized, Humashup was rebuilt down to the last woven hut, and the New Life Chumash Nation moved in.<br/> The next step was making more Chumash. </td>

He passed it back to Atrahasis, who paused a moment and then drank down what was left.<br/>He set down the cup and felt the biomechanicals swarming from under his<br/>tongue, massing in his bloodstream to neutralize what had been in the cup.

Any of those?”<br/>“Well, we did get a couple of songs about him from an old man who stayed here last winter,” I told him, noting that my red ink had sat too long and giving it a shake to mix it. “I don’t think his memory was very reliable, though.”<br/>“Ah! Well, I’ve got the complete cycle.

Spellbinding! Lewis was a good storyteller, too. He had a mobile, expressive face, elegant gestures, and a nice light baritone. My pen swept across the page.<br/>We didn’t even take a break until I got a paralyzing fit of writer’s cramp, just after the part where Finn calls his father’s ghost from the Land of the Blessed, and the old chief gives him advice. I got up and walked back and forth in the narrow stone room, swinging my arms, while Lewis took the opportunity to pour himself a cup of watered mead from the pitcher we’d brought.<br/>He sipped and held the cup out to the light. “My goodness, who’s your Beekeeper?

Aegeus let go of her hands and she drifted away from us, lifting the hem of her gown as she went, her slow dance resumed. She found her way to the wall and danced for the shadows a while, and then fell to running her fingertips over the stones, tracing their pattern under the pattern of light and shadow.<br/>“These aren’t human children, are they?” I stated.<br/>“Oddly enough, they are,” Aegeus told me, watching Maeve. “Rather more human than you or I, my young friend, given what we are.

It seemed the holy monks weren’t the only mortals who had a community at Malinmhor! There were creatures living in a warren nearby.

He lowered his eyes and murmured:<br/>“Unfortunately so, my lord.”<br/>Lewis stood there speechless a moment before he drew himself up and set his chin. “But Aristotle himself was a mortal,” he told the servant! “I think you can be trusted to read this text a little while, don’t you, without tearing it or chewing on it?”<br/>“I would never do such a thing, my lord,” the servant assured him. “I was trained in library science.”<br/>“Well then.” Lewis pulled out a chair for him. “Please, sit and read.”<br/>I’m not certain who was more shocked, the servant or myself; but after a frozen moment the mortal hastened to obey, as Lewis took his wine and carried it to the cushions next to mine. His eyes were angry.<br/>I must protest against this policy, he transmitted in silence. Why shouldn’t they be allowed to read their own books? Aren’t we preserving these things for THEM, after all?<br/>Old fellow, you must understand, I replied as casually as I could.

Destructive little Barbary<br/>apes for the most part, and human intelligence only makes them worse. How many libraries have you seen burned in your time?<br/>But the mortals built the libraries, too, argued Lewis, sipping his wine. I was at least pleased to note that he stopped and inhaled the bouquet before taking another, more appreciative sip. It takes thousands of them to create an archive of human wisdom; only one to set a torch to it.

I saw the little girl when they were parading her around. She was not so pale as her mother. Her skin was like rose petals and her hair like white gold, but she had the same great wide eyes and delicate face.<br/>Yet Maeve, it seems, grew jealous of all the attention paid to her daughter. They caught her pinching the baby when she thought she was alone with it. The infant was taken away, to be raised by Lady Maire, and Maeve found herself in real disgrace for the first time in her life.<br/>Lord Aegeus had no time for her now. All his attentions were focused on little Amelie, the daughter. It was decided that Maeve had performed her duties admirably, and would henceforth be allowed to rest. They allotted her a single room adjacent to the infirmary. She would be given no new husbands, as her health had begun to suffer from constant breeding.<br/>So I asked if I might have her back.<br/><br/>The lords and ladies bestowed her on me gladly enough, commending me for my sense of responsibility, but warned me that marital relations were best not resumed.

I was just telling him about Spinoza, Eliphal.”<br/>“Well, what a little fellow to get such a big assignment,” said Eliphal, leaning down to him like a kindly uncle. “And how old are you, Latif?”<br/>“Five, sir,” said Latif coolly, putting down the vase and bowing. “I recently read your dissertation on Manasse ben Israel, and may I say how impressed I was with your insights into the influences at work during his formative years?”<br/>“Uh—thank you.” Eliphal straightened up, blinking.<br/>“You’re quite welcome.”</td>

Here’s another piece of advice: Never let your subordinates keep pets, but if you must, make sure you’ve got a Zoologist stationed with you who knows how to physic a dog, or you’ll wind up doing it.”<br/>“I’ll remember that, too,” said Latif, looking appalled.<br/>The mortal with his trunk came after that, so I helped Latif get it up to his room. He insisted on squaring everything away before we went back downstairs, and I had to hide a smile at how finicky-neat he was, all his clothes pressed just so and severely grown-up in their cut. He even had a miniature grooming kit in a leather case! Silver-backed brushes and all; he only lacked a razor. Small wonder he looked askance at the toys I’d set out on his bed.<br/>“Sorry about those,” I told him. “I wasn’t expecting somebody quite so, um, mature.”<br/>“It was a charming thought,” he said courteously, giving one of his hats a last brush before setting it on a shelf. “And, after all, it does go with the character I’m portraying. I suppose I’ll need to observe mortal children to see how they behave, won’t I? Certainly all the rest of you seem to be doing a splendid job blending in with the mortal populace.”<br/>“Oh, it’s easy, really,” I assured him. “Easiest part of the job. What’s hard is coordinating the actual running of the station.”<br/>“I can’t wait to observe,” he replied, laying out his monogrammed (!!) towel beside the washbasin. “What shall we start with? Duty rosters? Security protocols? Access code transfers? Logistics?”<br/>Was there a little boy in there at all? The machine part was up and running, trust Labienus to see to that; but we work best as whole people, you know, same as the mortals.<br/>“Logistics,” I replied. “Want to come watch me get dinner for nine people on the table when the cook’s sick?”<br/></td>

<td>And so nothing useful had been done with Nicholas Harpole.<br/>Labienus sighs. So much potential in a bright child, if trained properly. All that splendid ability, wasted on one martyrdom to prop up some distant causal link to Dr. Zeus Incorporated …<br/>Here is a statistic to make his heart bleed over might-have-beens: out of the four hundred seventeen mortals who heard Nicholas preach as he was being burned at the stake, fully twenty-two had heeded his plea to become martyrs to the Protestant cause themselves. Two hundred twelve had gone on to lose their lives in less immediate ways, in the defense of English liberty. Eighty-six more had gone into various levels of what passed for the secret service at that time, working for the downfall of Spain with patient fanaticism under Sir Francis Walsingham. Fifty-one had simply committed suicide, in varying ways, over the three-year period following April 1, 1555.<br/>The point was, of course, that Nicholas Harpole had asked them to die, and they had. Or at least given up their lives. A miserable three hundred seventy-one mortals, when he might have laid waste to nations.<br/>Much better success on the second try. Labienus smiles, coming to the pages added later, the reports from other operatives. He hadn’t minded when the Adonai project had been taken from him. He’d been just settling in here at Mackenzie Base, and had too many irons in the fire to waste time shepherding another hapless youth from one self-destructive crisis to the next. It had helped his ego that the new project head was a close friend, of course.</td>

I’ve watched the mortals crowding into their stinking cities. Their coal-soot advances on the clean sky. The forests go down before their axes and the whales are pulled in and butchered alongside their ships. But, father, it’s not war or crime causing these things. It’s peace. Prosperity. Civilization!”<br/>“We will go after the industrialists, too, when we’re ready.”<br/>“But when will we be ready, father? How badly must it all deteriorate before we move at last?” demanded Labienus, pinning his hopes on sincerity. “You want to exterminate the murderers and generals, but they do the work we should have begun by now. The survival of the world is no longer a moral question, if it ever was. It’s a mechanical question. A matter of numbers.”<br/>“You think we ought to go after the mortals indiscriminately, to protect the earth,” said Budu.<br/><br/>“Yes!”<br/>“You are overruled.

He wore pajamas violently patterned with palm trees and vahines, not at all the kind of thing you’d expect a hunted man to wear. He had a long broken nose, and high broad cheekbones. When he rolled over, he exposed something strange twining up the back of his neck. It looked like a silver tattoo, in a pattern of vaguely Celtic-knot complexity.<br/>It was not a tattoo, however. It was a subcutaneous wire hooking Alec up to the artificial intelligence sailing his ship, for Alec was a cyborg. Not at all some human-machine hybrid with a whirring ocular implant and a toneless voice, oh dear no; that sort of fashion went out generations before Alec was born. In any case, being a peer, he could afford the most elegantly understated cybernetic implants.<br/>So much for what the hypothetical human observer would notice.<br/>It would be rather more likely that a surveillance drone would see all this, zooming in across such distance, noting such detail. And a surveillance drone, having the ability to tune in to the ship’s system, its cameras and indeed to Alec’s own cyborged brain, would see a great deal more.<br/>It would see, for example, two other men lying in the bed, at extreme arm’s length from Alec on either side, who appeared to be his nearly identical brothers.<br/>The virtual man who slept, or tried to sleep, on the left, looked slightly older than the other two. He lay stretched on his side, one hand under his pillow as though groping after something he’d hidden there. He wore only ivory-colored drawers of an antiquated design. His name was, or had been, Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.<br/>The virtual man on the right was not asleep at all. He lay on his back like an effigy on a tomb, clad in a flowing white shirt of even more antique design, his arms crossed on his chest. He gazed with an expression of despair on the gimbal lamp, which rocked gently as the ship crested each rolling swell, and which had dimmed itself to the comforting glow of a nursery light. He wasn’t comforted. His lips moved for a while in silent prayer. Tears welled in his eyes.<br/>He could hardly be blamed.

Its muzzle was a bare two inches from the face of Nicholas on the right, who recoiled from it. Alec, between them, opened startled eyes but lay motionless, staring at the pistol in confusion.<br/>Any hypothetical human viewer would be confused, too. Without a way to tap into Alec’s brain, he or she would have seen only the man in the bed’s center sitting up, pointing a gun at empty space to his right. And the cold glare and military bearing of the man were not those of anyone who would ever wear vahine-patterned pajamas by choice. This was because virtual Edward had just seized control of Alec’s real body.<br/>Edward! Belay that! said a gruff male voice, from a speaker concealed within a carving of a Spanish galleon.

<td>Muttering, Edward lay down and punched his virtual pillow savagely.<br/>A word or two of explanation might be helpful at this point. Neither Edward nor Nicholas were ghosts, technically; but during their respective lifetimes each had carried in his brain, quite unknown to himself, a sort of black box. This device recorded in electromagnetic analogue every sensation, thought, and emotion experienced from the moment of its installation (immediately after birth) to the moment of death.<br/>These recordings were made because neither Edward nor Nicholas were human, technically. They were Recombinants, as Alec was, and they had been made (very, very illegally) by an all-powerful cabal of scientists and investors known collectively as Dr. Zeus Incorporated, or more usually just the Company, which also possessed the secret of time travel, among other things.<br/>For reasons that will not be gone into immediately but involved ensuring its own existence, the Company had needed a Recombinant. A prototype was designed, DNA engineered to produce it, and three test embryos cloned from one blastocyst. They were then scattered across time, implanted in human mothers by hard-working immortal Company operatives. Being, after all, test runs, the prototypes were not made immortal.<br/>Nicholas and Edward, completely unaware of their destinies, nevertheless fulfilled them and died untimely if necessary deaths, whereupon the recorded sum of their lives went into their Company project files. Alec, however, had not died.<br/>Like his—clones? brothers? other selves?—Alec had certain abilities completely unguessed-at by his shadowy creators. Unlike them, he was born into an era of advanced technology. When, as a child, he had been given a cybernetic companion, he had not only been able to modify it to suit his tastes, he removed the safeguard that prevented it from breaking any laws in the fulfillment of its primary directive, which was to protect and nurture him.</td>

Upon discovering that his fairly unhappy childhood could be laid directly at the door of Dr. Zeus Incorporated, Alec and the Captain embarked upon a campaign of revenge and exposure. Unaware they were being cleverly manipulated by the Company to accomplish its goals (I said it was all-powerful) they stole one of the Company’s time shuttles and had a number of adventures that ended more or less disastrously for Alec and a lot of other people, though not for the Company.<br/>With its purpose for Alec fulfilled, the Company relaxed, confident in the expectation of his disposal when the time shuttle exploded, as it was scheduled to do. This failed to happen, however, because:<br/>In the course of his adventures with the time shuttle, Alec blundered into a Company penal institution located deep in prehistory. There he encountered one of the Company’s cyborg slaves, the hapless Botanist Mendoza, an immortal marooned in the past for reasons which included her knowledge of the Company’s Recombinant project. She had discovered Project Adonai by sheerest chance, when she had the misfortune to encounter, fall in love with, and fail to prevent the untimely deaths of first Nicholas and then, three hundred years later, Edward.<br/>She was, moreover, a Crome generator, the only immortal with a bizarre condition cursing its possessors with apparent psychic ability. Consequently her emotional health was not quite what was desired in an immortal, which was another reason she’d been confined to the agricultural station.<br/>Upon meeting Alec, Mendoza slept with him, accepted his proposal of marriage, and passed on to him certain classified information to assist him in his goal of bringing down Dr. Zeus Incorporated. She also disconnected the explosive device on the shuttle that was intended to destroy Alec once his usefulness to the Company ended.<br/>When, after several tragic accidents, Alec managed to equip his very large yacht with a time transcendence drive so he could go back to rescue Mendoza, he discovered that Dr. Zeus Incorporated had got there first.

And, unable to assimilate Nicholas’s or Edward’s memories, Alec developed a disassociative personality disorder and gave them independent individual existences, complete with virtual physical bodies in cyberspace.<br/>At least, that was the only rational explanation for what happened.<br/>After attempting (and failing) to administer drugs to banish Alec’s unwelcome guests, the Captain decided to let them stay, since both Nicholas and Edward had strengths and skills that might prove useful to Alec.<br/>Got it? All clear so far?<br/>The Captain’s experiment was not proving an unqualified success, since the three Recombinant gentlemen discovered they couldn’t stand their own company, and struggled constantly for control of the one real body they shared. One thing upon which they did agree, however, was the urgent necessity of finding and rescuing Mendoza.<br/>To this end, they hunted down their guilty creators and extracted at gunpoint the name of the prison where Mendoza was now confined: a site known only as Options Research.<br/>Then they fled, away through time to an empty night ocean, where they were presently attempting to rest while the Captain devised a plan for Mendoza’s rescue.</td>

Wherefore not then a clever mechanism? If a jack can be made to strike the hour in a clock, he may be made to speak, too; and such am I.

So might a clock comfort an astrolabe.”<br/>“Ah, well, sir, I’ve no soul, to be sure; but it might help to talk, all the same.”<br/>Nicholas lay back with a sigh, and gazed at the lamp.<br/>“I have been disputing with myself,” he said, “since I have awakened into this unnatural life of horrible marvels, on the nature of Almighty God.”<br/>“And how doth that make thee feel, lad?” inquired the Captain. Nicholas drew a deep breath and went on:<br/>“In regarding now the thing I am, that standeth outside mankind like a phantom, and observing how the world waggeth these late ages, and seeing the low truth of creation (which evolution my reason must accept, though my heart</td>

Oh, that I had my books that were burnt!” Nicholas gripped the blanket with both hands.<br/>“Then turn and look there, sir. See that text plaquette on yer night table? The thing what looks like green glass in a little window frame. Go ahead, pick it up. The other lads is both asleep, they won’t hinder thee. That’s a book, sir, of the kind we use in this day and age. My boy hath it to look at figures, but it hath a million texts in it beside. I’ll just open it for thee.”<br/>Nicholas caught his breath. The dark glass lit up and bright letters appeared, informing him that he beheld THE OLD TESTAMENT, diligently corrected and compared with the Hebrew, by William Tyndale and finished in the year of Our Lord God A. 1536, in the month of September at Vilvorde.<br/>He was struck speechless.<br/>“D’you like that, eh? Look, when thine eye comes to the bottom of the page, the book knows and goes on to the next one for thee. Nor needst thou a candle, for the book maketh its own light. Be’n’t it a wonder, lad?”<br/></td>

He had willingly submitted to entering the metal box. Of course, he might have changed his mind since. Far too much time had passed for his fate to be altered now, however, even if he had been able to tell Marco.<br/>Marco busied himself with arranging the table just as he wanted for what he had planned. He set out instruments, jars of chemicals; lifted Grigorii Efimovitch out to sprawl, trailing, on the steel surface. He pulled on a black rubberized raincoat, or something that looked a lot like one, and carefully worked transparent gloves on over his massive hands. He stepped out into the fast-fallen darkness and got himself another beer.<br/>He drank, belched gently, and selected an instrument from the table.

<td>The Pelican had been there a long time. It was rumored to have been transplanted, brick by brick, from some English village, back in the twentieth century when wealthy men still did things like that. It was named for the ship in which Sir Francis Drake had set out when he’d sailed off to loot the Spanish Main.<br/>It had once been a very expensive bed-and-breakfast hotel, bar, and five-star restaurant. Various wars, political secessions, and natural disasters had altered its fortunes. Over three centuries it had been successively a triage hospital, a barricaded freeholding, a farmhouse, a partial ruin, and other things. But, situated as it was at a crossroads in a picturesque cove, as soon as civilization had reasserted itself enough to provide some traffic, the Pelican had evolved back into an inn.<br/>Even a reasonably prosperous one, in this year of 2317. Plenty of trade from the local farmers and fishermen. Plenty of real money from the rich people who moored their pleasure boats in Muir Harbor, eager to get away from the General Prohibition in San Francisco.<br/>Not that there was anything all that immoral to be had at the Pelican, of course, beyond homemade ciders and ales and fish dinners. Mavis paid a fortune in bribes to local law enforcement to be able to serve even those; but the people from the big boats wanted the thrill of the forbidden, and spent hugely for it.<br/>Sometimes Mavis paid the local law enforcement to dress as picturesque smugglers, too, and they would lounge in her bar and leer pleasantly at the guests, or tell stories about desperate chases over the hills with kegs of mead. The guests would buy them drinks and would usually stay over an extra night. The local economy thrived to no end.<br/>Joseph saw the amber windows</td>

Gimme a leg up.”<br/>The bartender hoisted him obligingly, and he sat on the counter and groped in his coat pocket for the case of tools he carried. It’s useful being a cyborg, even a rogue one, when you have to realign a holoemitter. Mortals think you’re an itinerant electronics genius, and so it’s all right that you’re a faintly shabby little man who never seems to have much money.<br/>Joseph didn’t really need the tools, but he made a great show of using them anyway, and presently the holo images resolved and sharpened into one image, brilliantly clear in the dark midair: Mars, with the glassy dome and radiating green lines of the Martian Agricultural Collective near its equator, as a solemn voice lauded the courage of the first settlers sponsored by Areco. There was a half-hearted cheer from the patrons in the dart alley.<br/>Joseph shivered, thinking that today’s courageous settlers were tomorrow’s vicious terrorists. He didn’t feel like thinking about the Mars Two disaster right now, though; this was a happy occasion, and Mars Two had another thirty-five years of blissful ignorance of its fate. He leaped down and took a little bow, then turned to the bar expectantly.<br/>“So, am I good or am I good?”<br/>By way of answer the bartender thrust the big embossed glass mug into Joseph’s hand.

Darts plunking into the board. Somebody unused to real alcohol getting sick in Room Seven. Rush of cold air, smell of the sea and the green alder trees, somebody coming in—<br/>Instantly Joseph was on his feet, peering around the corner into the hall. But it was okay: two more well-groomed people in yachting clothes, murmuring in delight at how quaint everything looked, on their way to the bar. He settled back into his seat and relaxed, drank more of his cider, watched the fire.<br/>He recognized Mavis’s firm tread long before she came around the corner. He got to his feet, doing his best to look dignified and respectable for her, as he ought to look if he were the former executive consultant he always claimed to be. He knew she didn’t believe him, though in fact he’d been a consultant to a lot of people, including pharaohs, in his time; but that was okay. Their relationship wasn’t built on belief.<br/>She hove into sight like a Spanish galleon, and looked him up and down.<br/>“So it’s you again?”<br/>“Yes, ma’am,” Joseph said, giving her his most ingratiating smile. “Just stopped by on my way up the coast. Going to a business conference in Seattle, you know. Oh, and I had a look at your holoscreen. Works fine now. Just needed a little realignment.”<br/>“Really? How nice. As long as you’re here, you might look at a couple of other things that need realigning,” she told him quietly, slipping a key into his hand. “And take a shower first. I’ll have some supper sent up.”<br/>Sometimes it’s just great to be a Rogue Cyborg. Not only can Rogue Cyborgs fix holoscreens, there are a whole bunch of other useful things they can do better than mortals.<br/></td>

He’d turn his head and meet Edward’s or Nicholas’s stare, red-eyed, wretched. The memory would return and he’d begin crying again, and lie there sobbing inconsolably until Billy Bones would come creeping to the bed with the anesthesia mask, offering oblivion. Not even Edward resisted, now; and they’d all wash away to dreamless sleep again.<br/>Eventually dreams began, soothing therapeutic ones that made it plain how none of this was his fault, how it had only been an error of a decimal point, how nothing could have altered what had happened because history cannot be changed, how it was wonderful that he had rescued Mendoza after all, how lucky he was to be alive . . .<br/>In time he was able to be awake if he was drugged profoundly enough, and he and the others would lie there giggling feebly at the tingling stimulus Billy Bones applied to their feet, to their hands, to their ribs, to help the shattered bones knit.

What’s that mean?”<br/>“I shall ignore your infantile humor and will be happy to explain, since you’ve inquired,” said Edward condescendingly. “I have formulated a theory of cycles of development in the history of mankind. They repeat in ever-expanding patterns, producing ages of Technology, Faith, and Reason.”<br/>“Oh, that’s crap.”<br/>“No, it isn’t. Technology was the first age, when primordial Man crawled from his dark shelter and discovered that by the simple expedient of striking flints in various ways he could provide himself with both fire and weapons,” Edward said. “Will you grant me that?”<br/>“Okay,” said Alec grudgingly. “And?”<br/>“And so the brute beast found himself, as it were, master of his universe. He had, of course, no idea of any consequences. He simply forged ahead, lighting fires and making spears, as fast as his clumsy hands could go. The result was, potentially, a greater lifespan for Man, but new and terrible responsibilities which he utterly ignored,” said Edward.<br/>“Nowadays you’re supposed to say Humanity, you know. There were women back then, too,” Alec told him.<br/>“Allow me my metaphor, if you please,” snapped Edward. “To continue: over the ages, the consequences of Technology did begin to make themselves evident to primitive Man. Fires, and bloodier warfare, prompted fear in his dim mind. With so much death in evidence, it was impossible not to wonder about his own inevitable demise. This prompted shamans to caper about and pretend their ancestors were giving them advice on the problem, and so was born the First Age of Faith.”<br/>“And everybody went to Hell?” said Alec. Nicholas snorted.<br/>“Not at all. Religion’s quite useful, at a certain level. It provides a notion of moral behavior and, as such, is the origin of ethics,” said Edward, steepling his fingers. “It is, at least, a system of thought, if it doesn’t degrade into mysticism. It got Man’s attention away from how he might more effectively spear his neighbor long enough to allow Civilization to begin.”<br/></td>

<td>So you’re saying religion’s a good thing?”<br/>“I say nothing of the kind! It’s a tool, like the flint, and as such is nothing but potential. Whether it is used to good or evil effect depends on Man, the user,” said Edward seriously.<br/>“Okay.” Alec nodded. “I’ll agree with you on that.”<br/>“I will not,” muttered Nicholas.<br/>“Weren’t you reading? In any case, Order took form out of Chaos, and pure rational thought, Man’s highest achievement, leapt into existence!” said Edward with relish. “It attained its fullest expression amongst the classical Greeks, but the Romans applied it with the greatest effectiveness. Systematically and logically they spread Civilization throughout the known world, to a degree that was not equaled for a thousand years.”<br/>“The Romans were vile and depraved,” said Nicholas, setting the text plaquette aside.<br/>“They became so,” Edward agreed. “They discarded the disciplines that had made them strong. With no moral code informing their lives, life became meaningless. This coincided with what one might call the Second Age of Technology. The superior engineering skills, the advances in metallurgy, all the tremendous and brilliant machine of their empire roared along with no purpose other than serving the appetite of its creators, who had no thought for the inescapable consequences any more than brute Man with his flints had.”<br/>“Well?” said Alec. “So what happened?”<br/>“The judgment of God came on Rome,” said Nicholas.<br/>“Absurd! Rome fell because of errors in its judgment,” Edward argued heatedly. “Without rational guidance the great machine destroyed itself, and so followed the Second Age of Faith.”<br/>“The Dark Ages of Christianity, right?” said Alec. Nicholas turned to him with an expression of outrage and Edward snickered. “It’s true,” Alec insisted. “And it wasn’t just Christianity. Islam happened, too. All those people beheaded and burned at the stake over nothing, man.”<br/>“Ay. Nothing,” Nicholas agreed sullenly. “Sacrifices offered up to a God of bestial cruelty. Yet even so, in that Dark Age, who but Christ’s disciples had thy precious Civilization in their keeping? Who but they, and the Jew, and the Moor with his Koran, made books and schools, lest that Aristotle become a mute ghost?

An Empire with real moral purpose.”<br/>“Oh, hark at the Crown of Creation,” jeered Nicholas. “I’ve seen the dust wherein thine Empire fell. Rags, shrouds and cobwebs! Love was no part of its design, but only profit, and its loveless heart went to ashes at last. And thou too art humbled in thy pride, and liest here a phantom like me, dead and forgotten.”<br/>Edward considered him, tight-lipped. “That remains to be proven,” he said at last. “And if the great wheel brought my age to an end, it will turn again.”<br/>“The Enlightenment didn’t stop,” said Alec. “It’s still going on. We got out into space, didn’t we? We’ve got more science than you ever had.”<br/>“No; you have Technology,” said Edward, a little wearily. “Tremendous power, wielded unwisely. The rest of human knowledge has been jettisoned as unnecessary. You’re illiterate, you believe in nothing, your lives have no meaning, no moral compass, no point.”<br/>“Maybe because we’ve learned something you haven’t,” said Alec in a cold voice. “You and your logical systems! You think you know everything. There’s nothing to know, man, except that our genes will do anything to copy themselves. What makes you imagine the world is a rational place?”<br/>“Your world isn’t, to be sure,” Edward replied. “And unless I’m mistaken, the next Age of Faith is already looming on the horizon, in the person of the Ephesian Church. Serves you right, too.”<br/>Alec shuddered.<br/>“But if it’s all just this big wheel going around endlessly—then we’re right, believing in nothing,” he said. “There is no point.”<br/>“Yes, there is,” said Edward and Nicholas together.<br/>“There is Love,” said Nicholas.<br/>“There is Progress! And if, just once, a new cycle began that unified, rather than rejected the advances made by the previous ages,” said Edward, “if Faith were able to make its peace with Reason, or Technology able to grasp the principles and purpose of the other two, Mankind might make real progress at last! Don’t you see that once we’ve brought the Company down, our true work can begin?”</td>

<td>Poor Alec. I can see you’re still in the grip of Company persuasion. They gave you a death wish, and you can’t master it; how sad. I, on the other hand, have moved beyond all that. Edward made an elegant gesture of dismissal.<br/>Oh yeah?<br/>Yes. If only you had the power to envision it, Alec! Eternal summer and eternal youth in which to enjoy eternal love. You might wander with our lady, hand in hand, down any empty beach in any age of the world, like two innocents in Paradise! And what harm could you do anyone, then? When we worked our evil, you and I, we did so out of grim resolution and duty. We believed we must sacrifice our own happiness to improve the lot of mankind. Edward shook his head sadly. He looked into Alec’s eyes and his voice was smooth, suave, infinitely persuasive.<br/>If we’d followed our hearts and run away with the girl, all this misery might have been avoided. Ah, but now we have the chance! Break the pattern of your own death, as she so hoped you would. Think what she suffered for your sake!<br/>“ ‘Quae est ista quae progreditur quasi aurora consurgens,’ ” Nicholas quoted, breathing heavily. “ ‘Pulchra ut luna, electa ut sol, terribilis ut acies ordinata?’ ”<br/>“Oh!” Mendoza’s eyes widened. “We used to be . . . you used to . . .”<br/>You know, Alec, lad, I don’t think I could add a word to what our Edward’s just said. Beautiful way you have of expressing yerself, Commander Bell-Fairfax, sir, if I may pay you the compliment. And yet it couldn’t be plainer put.<br/>Thank you. I thought so.<br/>LEAVE ME ALONE! Alec had tears in his eyes. I killed three thousand people on Mars, man! What the shrack am I supposed to do now? Live happily ever after?<br/>You ain’t going to do nobody no good by dying, son.<br/>Trust me, Alec; there are better ways to atone for your crimes than throwing your life away, said Edward. I know from painful experience.<br/>Go to Hell.</td>

She looked up at him questioningly; he nodded.<br/>“Thank you very much, Sir Henry,” she said.<br/>Bless yer little heart! I thought you might want breakfast in bed this morning, Alec lad, so here comes old Coxinga with a nice tray. Coffee and toast, oatmeal, orange juice, and oyster savory. Sorry there ain’t no fresh strawberries, Mrs. Checkerfield, but the botany cabin went right to Hell whilst you was sick.<br/>Edward laughed and applauded silently.<br/>“Strawberries?” Mendoza’s eyes widened, focused intensely. “Fragaria moschata. Yes. But . . .” She looked perplexed. “How did we grow them on a ship? We would have to have hydroponic trays.”<br/>Why, er, so we did, dearie.<br/>Alec gave the camera a warning look. “Of course, the botany cabin’s all been dismantled for a little while,” he said. “But we’ll fix it up again, so you can grow things.”<br/>Oh, that’s already begun, lad—Cargo Bay Number Three, remember?</td>

Alec, son, here it is: you ain’t never been sick a day in yer life, and I reckon if you lived quiet like a sensible man it’d take a couple of centuries to wear you down. But there’s accidents, Alec, whether you go out of yer way to get killed like these two fine fellows done or just get hurt bad.

Boy, is it not plain? We can’t lie to her forever.<br/>I know, said Alec, turning his head to look at Mendoza where she lay curled in Nicholas’s arms. And I know what I’ve got to do. So you can just shut up about it, Edward, yeah? I’ll have the damn immortality operation, or whatever it is.<br/>That’s my little Alec.<br/>After what she’s been through, this is the least I can do for her. Especially if it’s the only way we can keep her safe.<br/>Good lad, purred Edward. A sensible choice and, moreover, a moral one.<br/>Why, son, it ain’t going to be no harder than getting yer tattoo. It’ll just take a little longer. You might say this is Nature taking her right and proper course, aye.<br/>But Alec turned to Nicholas.<br/>Do you think it’s the right thing to do?<br/>Nicholas looked down at Mendoza as she slept.<br/>Go on, Nick. You been studying religion; tell him it’s right.<br/>Ay, Nicholas said. Since it is done for love’s sake. What other law is left?<br/>Alec nodded slowly.<br/>That’s my good Nick! Now that we’re all square, Alec, there’s things we need to consider. I can start you on the Pineal Tribrantine Three straight off. The place we’re stuck, I reckon, is that there crucible of prime DNA you were made from. I’ve already lifted the file for Adonai out of Dr. Zeus’s archives. I even got biomechanicals designed what’s better than the Company uses! Every one of ’em a molecular Philosopher’s Stone. But I need that DNA for a genetic template. Think of it like a treasure map, Alec, what’ll tell the little bastards where they got to go for the loot.<br/>Then obviously the next step is to locate the crucible, said Edward, and take it. Would it be a silver tube like the one in Mendoza’s file?<br/>Aye, sir, likely, or a bit bigger. You were a lot more valuable, being an experimental prototype, so they’d have made a bucket of it.<br/></td>

Its conclusions were: that Crome’s radiation somehow caused an individual’s electromagnetic field to bleed over into the temporal field, which perhaps caused what appeared to be precognition or déjà vu in certain mortals. Also, telekinesis could perhaps be explained by Crome’s causing a disruption in the temporal field, freezing objects briefly in time while space (following its normal orbital trajectory) swung out from under them. This perhaps accounted for documented cases of solid objects appearing to leap off shelves or float through midair, or even rain down out of a cloudless sky.<br/>It might also account for the ongoing phenomena with the garden, wherein plants shot from seed to maturity in a night. Mendoza seldom generated Crome’s on these occasions, but did seem to be able to produce the temporal distortion at will. Just how she did it remained a mystery. She had not volunteered any explanation, apparently under the impression that Alec also had the ability, and neither he nor the Captain had considered it wise to disabuse her of this idea yet.<br/>The Captain made calculations, drew up tables.

You could inquire at his offices, up on Maiden Lane.”<br/>“Yes, I might at that.” Edward nodded.<br/>“Do you suppose, if we were very careful, we might walk through this one?” Mendoza said. “Just to see what the others will be like?”<br/>“Well—since you’re interested—well, sure,” said the foreman, doffing his own hat and coming forward to offer her a hand up over the foundation.

While they wait for their pizza, the young lady strikes up a conversation with the elderly gardener, who is setting a baby tree in the deep hole that has been dug for it.<br/>He’s astonished to discover how well she speaks the dialect of his village, and how much she knows on the subject of date palms. They engage in a lengthy conversation that ends only when the project foreman stalks up, demanding impatiently that the gardener finish planting the damned palm.<br/>The young couple excuse themselves and finish their pizza. The old gardener goes back to shoveling earth around the roots of the little palm.

He had appeared in the common room of the Goat and Compasses one night in 1660 with no belongings other than a small sea chest and the clothes on his back. After a meal, a warming glass of rum, and an hour’s charming conversation, he had somehow taken up the position in Miss Venables’s life that he had occupied, with few interruptions, ever since.<br/>And really she could not, in any way, admit that she regretted the nuptial arrangement. In addition to his considerable proficiency in the arts of love, Dr. Ansolabehere was quiet and clean, and never attempted to exert control over the household although he was, as she discovered, an excellent financial advisor. He was a capable surgeon (which even the most genteel of taverns required now and then), did not drink to excess, and tolerated her occasional infidelities with the greatest amiability. Best of all, he had an absolutely reliable remedy for the Pox.<br/>There were only two peculiarities about the man: his obstinate refusal to market the remedy, which Mrs. Ansolabehere found most vexing, for it might have earned them more than six sugar plantations if sold freely in Port Royal; and his sea chest.<br/>The sea chest was quite small, quite heavy, and never opened. Indeed, as far as Mrs. Ansolabehere knew its lock had no key. This need not present any difficulty for a determined woman with the proper hairpin, but Dr. Ansolabehere seldom let it out of his sight.

If at any time during his temporary absence from the house the sea chest should begin to whistle, she was to let him know immediately, regardless of where he might be or what he might be doing. So firmly had he insisted upon this, and with such an unpleasant and unaccustomed light of adamance in his black eyes, that Mrs. Ansolabehere had been quite unsettled for some hours afterward.<br/>Judge, then, with what vexation Mrs. Ansolabehere received the news from Caroline, her maid, that there was an odd sound coming from Dr. Ansolabehere’s room; especially since this news was conveyed whilst Mrs. Ansolabehere was greeting none other than the Lieutenant Governor himself, Captain Sir Henry Morgan, who had arrived with a party of friends and was intent on aggravating his dropsy with a few hours’determined application of Mrs. Ansolabehere’s best rum.<br/>“What?” she hissed over her shoulder at Caroline.<br/>“It be squealing, ma’am,” repeated Caroline.<br/>“Why then, go—go poke under the bed with a broom, sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Away! My apologies, Sir Henry. Here is my best table, with a cool breeze from the door, and here is John to serve. Will you dine, too? For I assure you I have an excellent hotpot on the fire.”<br/>“No damn’d soup,” growled Sir Henry, lifting his haggard face. “I’ve enough water in me as it is.” He did not resemble the dumpy self-satisfied fellow depicted in Exquemelin’s notorious Buccaneers of America (a careful examination of its illustrations will reveal that all the pirates in that lurid compendium seem to be drawn from one model) but rather the other attributed likeness, the shadowy three-quarter portrait of the dark saturnine man in red, smiling enigmatically as the Mona Lisa. “Rum, madam! And ginger biscuits if you’ve got ’em.”<br/>“To be sure,” Mrs. Ansolabehere said. “Sent hot to the table, sir, within the hour!”<br/>She and Annie, the cook, were frantically getting a pan of ginger biscuits into the oven when Caroline reappeared in the doorway of the kitchen, clutching a broom.<br/>“It be still squealing, ma’am,” she said, close to tears. “And it ain’t under the doctor’s bed, ma’am. It be the little chest what’s squealing, ma’am.”<br/>Upon hearing this, Mrs. Ansolabehere swore an oath, gathered up her skirts, and ran upstairs to see for herself.</td>

The game went on longer this time, but only because there were twice as many opponents. Edward was playing faster still.<br/>The console housing the game began to hum faintly.<br/>Edward scored 100,000 and the game began again without preamble. They were demons, now, hurling themselves at him and dissolving in blood-bursts of all colors, grotesques, and they came apart and surged back as the others had not, so that he was sometimes facing more than one opponent at a time. Though he was shifting now slightly from side to side within the body frame, his speed of kill diminished not one iota and his score rose inexorably toward 1,000,000.

Tiara didn’t understand the big words and concepts that the Memory gave her, about biomechanicals and electromagnetic pulses and disruption, but it had been a great day indeed for Uncle Ratlin when he’d finally killed the slave.<br/>Ever since, Uncle Ratlin had gone more and more among the big people, about his business in broad daylight even, and brought home wonderful presents for Quean Barbie. There was a great plan that was going to make them all very happy one day, that would avenge the kin and bring about the ruin of the big people and their slaves forever, and it all hinged on Uncle Ratlin’s invention.</td>

<td>Tiara picked her way into the room and stood looking down at the dead slave critically. Really, he didn’t look very bad; much nicer than all those old bones. He would do, she decided, for pretend kin.<br/>But what could you play with a thing that couldn’t talk back to you? Tiara thought about it and her little face brightened. She ran off to her own hiding place and returned in a moment, carrying the pink and green acrylic afghan and a beer bottle she had filled with spring water. Sitting down beside the dead slave, she pulled his head and shoulders into her lap and awkwardly wrapped him in the afghan; then she tilted the bottle to his lips, pretending to feed him, spilling water down his waxen face.<br/>“Pretty little baby, pretty little baby,” Tiara crooned. “Drink your nice milk and go to sleep.”<br/>She had, like all the rest of her race, the power of absolute concentration on what interested her at the moment, fixation to a degree that would baffle one of the big people. So intent on her game was she, it mattered nothing to her that the dead slave trembled abruptly, that his mouth opened and fastened on the neck of the bottle, that he proceeded to gulp down the water.<br/>“Good little baby,” Tiara sang approvingly. “Such a good baby, he drinks it all gone. Isn’t he clever! Mummy’s very pleased with him.”<br/>The slave lay still, gasping for breath. She lifted the bottle away and he moved his lips as though he were speaking, but Tiara couldn’t hear anything. “Oh, he’s parched, he’s parched and dry, he needs a whiskey to tell that story!” she sang. “Does he want a whiskey, then?”<br/>The slave might have nodded, or it might have been a shiver. Tiara decided to play it for a nod and jumped up, running off to the spring for more water. She returned in triumph and settled back down, lifting his head and holding the bottle for him. “Drink, drink!” she chanted. “And grow up big and strong.”<br/>He finished the water and sighed, and his head sagged back on her arm. His lips moved again and this time she heard him speak, distinctly, a whisper of thanks.<br/>“He can talk to me,” she squealed in delight. “Talk to me more, slave!”<br/>His eyes opened. She exclaimed, and leaned down to peer into them. They were a</td>

<td>“Ah,” he said, shuddering. “So I’ve been thrown away? How long have I been in here?”<br/>“Always,” Tiara said. Her tiny brows drew together in a frown. “Uncle Ratlin will be mad. You were supposed to be dead.”<br/>“Oh, but—” How rapid the slave’s breathing became. “You don’t want him to be mad, do you? And if you tell him I’m still alive, he’ll want to kill me again. And if he does that, I won’t be able to talk to you. You see?”<br/>Tiara saw. “It’s a secret,” she decided.<br/>“Oh, yes, Princess Tiara, it’s our secret. Please?” The slave’s voice shook. “You won’t tell anyone I’m alive in here, and I can talk to you, and play all the games you like.”<br/>“But you’re broken,” Tiara pointed out.<br/>“Well, that’s true, but I might get better. I’m sure I would, if I had enough time,” the slave argued earnestly. “I couldn’t even talk or think before, and then you gave me water to drink, and just listen to me now! I’m talking and thinking like mad.”<br/>“I’ll get you more water,” Tiara announced.<br/>She got up and ran from the room, not noticing his cries of: “Wait! Little girl! Princess! Oh, please, for gods’ sake, don’t leave me!” When she came back after refilling the bottle, he turned his face at once as he heard her come in. “Princess Tiara?” he called desperately.<br/>“Don’t cry, little baby,” she said, putting the bottle to his mouth. He gasped and drank again, so quickly some of the water spilled and ran down like his tears.<br/>“Thank you, sweet little princess,” he gasped.<br/>“I like that.” She smiled. “Tell me I’m a sweet little princess again.”<br/>“Oh, you are! You’re the dearest, sweetest little princess there’s ever been.”<br/>“Tell me you love me.”<br/>“I love you!”<br/>“And I love you,” she emoted, clasping her hands together and tossing her head back. “You are my perfect treasure, and I die for wanting you!”<br/>The slave’s mouth worked oddly. “My dearest love, you must never die,” he cried. “Surely if you die the stars will all go out!”<br/></td>

If only I could see! Will you look for me, dear little princess, and tell me: have I still got both my legs?”<br/>Dutifully Tiara leaned over and looked, though she knew perfectly well. “Yes,” she sang. “Ten fingers and ten toes, why, he’s perfect!”<br/>“Both my feet are still there, then? And my arms and hands?”<br/>“Yes, my treasure.”<br/>“Apollo be thanked. Am I cut, my dearest? Have I wounds anywhere?”<br/>“My poor brave hero.” Tiara pretended to weep. “They have murdered you entirely, there is blood in your beautiful golden hair.”<br/>“Is there?” The slave blinked, frowning. “Yes. I remember that. He tried to open my skull. So there’s a wound in my head, my love?”<br/>“Uh-huh.”<br/>“Ha. Well, don’t trouble your heart, my darling.” The slave ran his tongue over his lips. “If you’ll look after me—if you’ll bring me water and food—my body will have what it needs to begin repairing itself. I don’t know how badly I’m damaged, but if I can regain some function—any function—” The slave began to tremble, and calmed himself. “Why, what a grand time we’ll have. And I can tell you stories—do you like stories, Princess Tiara?”<br/>“Oh, yes,” she assured him.<br/>“Well then! Do you know, I was a Literature Preservation Specialist—” The slave’s voice broke. He swallowed hard and went on, “And what that means is, I know every story in the wide world. I will be your own storyteller, princess dear, and nobody else will have such fine stories told. Only to you will I tell them. Will you like that?”<br/>“More than anything, my prince,” said Tiara and sighed. Then, in a completely sensible voice, she added, “Except you aren’t really a prince. You’re just my slave.”<br/>“Ah! Yes, but only your slave,” he insisted. “I would be slave to none but the beautiful Princess Tiara. I’m afraid if you tell anybody I’m here, they’ll come take me away from you.”<br/>“Nobody will do that,” Tiara told him, patting his cheek. She knew how to keep secrets.</td>

With that exception there was no day or night, no sense of days or weeks passing or what that might mean.<br/>But there were the stories, and the little rhymes the slave knew. For a long while there was Cinderella and Puss in Boots and Hickory Dickory Dock, intoned in his weary patient voice from the moment Tiara yawned and sat up until the moment she’d yawn and snuggle down beside him. She had dragged her scraps of blanket and dead-leaf nesting into the bone room and made a cozy place there against the slave’s body. She left it only to find food and drink for them.</td>

There were snails. The slave had shuddered at these, at first, and then made a game that they were escargot with garlic butter in white wine sauce. Sometimes Tiara would creep down to the farm and take anything that appealed to her from the big man’s kitchen, and sometimes things from his yard. Once there were towels left out to dry on the line overnight, and Tiara carried them away gleefully; for as her slave began to get better he could feel the cold, and she liked to wrap warm things about his shivering body, or wad them between him and the stony floor.<br/>As Tiara got older and more skillful she learned to milk the big beasts into a jar, and would carry it back to her slave with scarcely a drop spilled. Then they’d feast on the cream, and with his throat refreshed the slave could go on with the astonishing stories, about Jason and the Argonauts, about Odysseus, about Rama and Sita.<br/>Tiara loved her slave. With just a little food and care he became much nicer to look at: the wound in his head healed over and he regained use of one of his arms, dragging himself upright to lean against a wall. Nor was he loud, as the big people were, but soft-spoken, and as self-effacing as the stupids that served Quean Barbie. Tiara assumed this was because he was a slave.<br/>The only trouble she would ever have with him was when he would cry. Sometimes he’d begin to cry and be unable to stop, and shouting at him or stamping her feet never helped; so she learned those were the times to play Mummy, and kiss the tears from his cheeks (she liked the salty flavor) and stroke</td>

Every myth and legend an immortal mind might compile in two thousand years of careful work? And telling them once would never be enough, for the devouring attention of a child. There are always stories to be told over and over, until the listener repeats them with the teller, pause for pause, breath for breath, word for ceaseless word, unappeased, unappeasable.<br/>Quean Barbie, up in her warm chamber with her captive suitors and her silent attendants, watched game shows and soap operas and Elvis holoes. Down in the dark, Princess Tiara drank of a different brew, began to grow into another kind of Quean entirely.<br/>Her tastes did form around romances, as she grew. Every tale of chivalry and passion the slave had ever sung when he’d been a troubadour, she loved: Tristan and Isolde, Arthur and Guinevere, Pelleas and Melisande. Every jongleur ditty about Robin and Marian. All the Shakespeare love plays, acted out in the slave’s beautiful voice and with the gestures of his one good hand. Heathcliff and Cathy, Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester enchanted Tiara. When he recited Alfred Noyes’s The Highwayman for her, she wanted it every night after that for years.<br/>Princess Tiara grew small high breasts, and began to develop a certain interest in the slave’s anatomy. No use; he couldn’t make those parts work, damaged as he was, and he explained that it wasn’t good for a little girl to start that sort of play too early anyway. Carefully, phrasing with exquisite tact, he made a request. She agreed, and the next night she went down to the farmhouse and rummaged around in the big man’s bedroom as he slept. She returned in triumph with a pair of thin cotton dress trousers, and helped the slave pull them on over his nakedness. Once his man parts were covered she forgot all about them. He did look so funny, with the big baggy trousers rolled up on his thin legs!<br/>But the clothes made him happy, and Tiara liked making her slave happy.<br/>Now that she had breasts, now that he had trousers, the long hours of talk changed.

Thought he’d killed him. Careful, careful now.<br/>“I am not interested in your kind offer, sir,” she told Uncle Ratlin, though the Memory was telling her this was the life she was meant for, this was the life that offered everything she could possibly desire for herself, lovers and status and presents!<br/>“Ah, now.” Uncle Ratlin looked at her anxiously. “You don’t really mean that. I know what it is. You’re scared of the old bitch. Sweetie, precious babe, she’s old. And think of the kin. If you don’t come back, honey love, what’ll we all do? No new stupids to make things, no new Uncles to plot for us! And there’s such plotting to be done, now that we’ve almost got the delivery system perfected. Don’t you want to see our ancient enemies ruined entirely?”<br/>Tiara shivered, searching the Memory for the right thing to say. “I wouldn’t go back for all the tea in China,” she said, though she had only the vaguest idea what that meant. “Live in that bitch’s house? Wear her clothes? Sleep in her sheets? You reek of her, you faithless bastard.” And she gave Uncle Ratlin what she hoped was an imperious stare.<br/>To her great delight he cringed and whined. Then he looked crafty. “Clever little thing, good baby girl, she’s holding out for a better price,” he crowed. “That’s my darling, what a Quean you’ll make! What do you want, sugar, do you want a SoundBox? You want lipsticks? You want cider from the Rising Moon? Or is it nicer things and more refined you want, my jewel? Of course! You’re an educated young lady, and I wonder how? But it’s holonovels you want, Love’s Purple Passion and Her Scarlet Amours, isn’t it? I can bring you all your sweet heart could possibly require, baby love.”<br/>“No,” said Tiara, lighting up inside because she’d had the most wonderful idea. “I spit on such things. If you are to win my hand, base varlet, you must be worthy. I shall set you a task, and if it is fulfilled to the letter, I shall be yours; but only then.”<br/>What a thrill, to see Uncle Ratlin stand speechless with amazement, and annoyance, and respect!

<td>The Captain stands regarding Mendoza thoughtfully. After a moment he extends a yearning hand and places it on her brow, as flames leap up through his illusory fingers.<br/>His gesture of affection is not meant for her, though he’s quite fond of Mendoza, in his way; Artificial Intelligences are just as capable of devotion as human beings are. She’s a well-behaved and obedient cyborg, but what really matters is that she loves his boy. Somewhere behind her brow, in a locked file, his boy’s consciousness is trapped. So is that of a similarly disembodied gentleman named Nicholas Harpole. Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax shut them both in there, and only Edward knows the code to release them.<br/>The Captain has taken care of Alec since Alec was five years old. He’s not quite sure what the other two entities are. They were once living men, earlier versions of Alec produced by the same Company responsible for creating him from recombinant DNA. When they had served the Company’s purpose and been killed, an electromagnetic recording of their personalities—memories, emotions, skills—had gone into storage in their files and remained there, inactive, until Alec accidentally downloaded them into his own brain while fleeing from the Company into the deep past.<br/>The result was a remarkable case of multiple-personality disorder for Alec and a continuing logistical nightmare for the Captain. The only thing on which the three gentlemen wholeheartedly agreed was the fact that they loved Mendoza, who had known each of them in their successive incarnations.<br/>Nicholas Harpole, who lived in the sixteenth century and was a scholar and heretic, managed to adjust somehow to massive culture shock and loss of the foundation on which his religious beliefs stood; but then he was an extraordinary man.<br/>So was Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax.<br/>Edward lived in the nineteenth century and was a political agent for the British Empire. He absorbed all the virtues and most of the vices of that massive institution, along with the cold-blooded practicality that enabled him to do his very unpleasant job. He died heroically in the service of the Gentlemen’s Speculative Society, an earlier version of Dr. Zeus Incorporated. His subsequent discovery that they lied to him most of his brief life has not been received well and, unfortunately for his creators, Edward has read Frankenstein.<br/>He doesn’t think much of his other selves, either.<br/>He dismisses Nicholas as a medieval zealot, limited by ignorance and religious superstition. Cybergenius Alec is in his opinion a dunce, the inevitable product of a soft and degenerate age, and worse: for Alec had been naïve enough to smuggle weapons to a particularly foolhardy group of rebels, and the result had been the destruction of an entire colony on Mars. Hence Alec’s flight, with technology he’d stolen from Dr. Zeus, into the past.<br/>Edward’s perception of these other selves has decided him that he alone is fit to inhabit Alec’s body. His effort to achieve this state of independence has been partly responsible for the accident that brought him, maimed and broken, to the regeneration tank, and Mendoza to her present state of impairment, and Alec and Nicholas to … well, to the place they now inhabit.<br/>But even if the accident had not occurred, Edward’s efforts to kill Alec should have been in vain. Edward is, after all, only a recording, nothing more than a program Alec himself is running, in disassociation response to the psychic trauma of having two additional lifetimes thrust into his memory. Or is he? Why can’t Edward be shut off?<br/>And what exactly has happened to Alec and Nicholas?</td>

<td>So I suppose we’re omnipresent now. Omnitemporal? But not truly omnipotent, as Edward hastens to correct me: “Only to the limits of my observational ability, my dear.”<br/>It appears that the truth about Time is rather more complex than we were told in school. Dr. Zeus explained to its little cyborgs that mortals perceive time in a linear way, because they have no other frame of reference; but in reality (they said) it is more of a spiral than a line, and when you learn to step across from one part of the spiral to another, you can travel through time. It would seem, however, that the Company wasn’t telling the truth. As usual.<br/>Whoever first learned how to travel in time, whether it was the Company or those little pale people from whom it stole its technology—it appears they took one look at the awful incoherent vastness of it all, screamed, and hastily projected conduits of artificial linear time with which to travel through the mess in a more or less orderly way. The restriction against being able to travel forward in time was a result of the conduit system. Real time is nonlinear, chaos, all-simultaneous, extending through every direction and dimension at once, and Edward alone knows what this does to causality. Entropy is an artifact of mortal perception.<br/>We, of course, are beyond all that now, ascended beings that we are.</td>

<td>The little town of Garrapatta was blessed with many advantages, but stability wasn’t one of them.<br/>For nearly six centuries now it had clung to the black mountain above Cape San Martin, with varying degrees of success. Every so often it lost its grip, for one reason or another; either the winter storms would precipitate a slide or the San Andreas Fault would shrug, and greater or lesser portions of Garrapatta would plummet into the sea.<br/>But its handful of citizens were a hardy lot, long accustomed to minor inconveniences like abrupt changes in elevation or rappelling down cliffs to purchase groceries. There were so many reasons to stay there! The breathtaking view of the Pacific, the grandeur and isolation of the coastline, the bubbling springs, the fresh air …<br/>All the same, when the last bad El Niño had relocated the entire business district (five of the town’s eight public buildings had landed in a colony of elephant seals) there was reluctant talk of abandonment. The Protector had come to Garrapatta’s rescue, however.<br/>Yes, Mr. Hearst had kindly evacuated the refugees and provided shelter for them down the coast at San Simeon while he brought in engineers, architects, and the most expensive antigravity technology. Over a period of five years the townsite was stabilized, the road restored, the businesses rebuilt. The citizens of Garrapatta now had every assurance that, regardless of how much the mountain moved in future, antigravity would keep their community exactly where it was. Any problems related to floating in midair could be solved with a few sturdy foot bridges.<br/>The return of the natives was quite a gala event. They were loaded into Mr. Hearst’s own superyacht, provided with box lunches and taken up the coastline to the new boat landing he had built next to the former seal colony. There they disembarked and rode in the new antigravity elevator up to Garrapatta, where a brass band on the deck of the new general store played “Home, Sweet Home.” One of Mr. Hearst’s public relations people (he seldom appeared in public himself) then provided the townsfolk with a guided tour of the civic improvements.<br/>Every least shack and vegetable patch had been faithfully restored, the general store was more spacious, the Vertical Café had lost none of its crusty charm, and the Garrapatta Springs Hotel had plumbing and new towels in case they ever had guests. Nor was this all: Mr. Hearst had even provided Garrapatta with a ninth structure, the Phoebe Apperson Hearst Memorial Cultural Center.<br/>This was a great improvement on the old Garrapatta Cultural Center, which had been housed in the hotel lobby and consisted of three holoes and a broken holoprojector. The new cultural center loomed grandly above the town, a building of reinforced concrete dug well into the mountain, with an ornate façade in Spanish Renaissance style. Within was stored a library of over a million entries in holo entertainment, games, music, and even literature, though the only one of Garrapatta’s citizens who could read was the cultural center’s new curator, Joseph X. Machina. Smiling and urbane, he shook hands with his new neighbors and hoped they’d all attend the Saturday night film fests he was planning.<br/>The brass band went home, the public relations person went home, and life returned to what passed for normal in Garrapatta.</td>

A heap of stones, a few logs won’t be noticed.”<br/>“Yeah, but—” said Joseph, and paused, for as he thought about it it began to make a certain sense.<br/>“Any of my men can make his own weapon in an hour,” explained Budu patiently. “You remember what a flint axe can do, when it’s wielded by a master. The fighting will be over quickly.”<br/>“This could work,” said Joseph in awe. “Won’t we need thongs, though? Where are we going to get water buffalo hide in this day and age?”<br/>“Son.” Budu looked pained. “We’re making weapons, not historical reproductions. Composite ramilar cord will suit our purposes. Have the boy acquire the principal factory that makes it. We’ll need six thousand meters.”<br/>“Gotcha,” said Joseph</td>

One week from today, you might say the Company will be downsized.” He looked around to see if the old-fashioned word had confused anyone, but they seemed to have grasped his meaning. “After all, with temporal operations shut down we won’t need the operatives anymore.”<br/>“But… won’t we lose a lot of revenue from the Day Six places?” asked Telepop.<br/>“The cut in overhead costs when we retire the operatives will more than compensate us,” Freestone explained. “Just think: no maintenance expenses, no</td>

Except that we’re all a lot richer than we were when the program started.”<br/>“And we made the bad things not happen,” said Bugleg.<br/>“What?”Telepop stared across the conference table at him.<br/>“The, er, wars and things,” Rossum explained for him.<br/>“Well—but they did happen,” said Roche. “Didn’t they?”<br/>“Yes, but not as expensively!” Freestone stated. “And that was the whole point of the business, you see?”</td>

<td>Victor was preoccupied.<br/>He had been preoccupied for days. His rooms were crowded now with stacked crates, and if a Public Health Monitor were to burst in for an inspection at that particular moment, Victor would have a great deal of explaining to do.<br/>What was in all those stacked crates? Dangerous and immoral contraband, though once it would have been described as Christmas cheer or gourmet delicacies, garnered patiently from Third World sovereignties over a period of two years. There were bottles of old port, dark as blood, in those crates, there were bottles of the most costly champagnes. Liqueurs. Pate full of truffles, tiny containers of caviar. Obscure herbs and spices, wonderfully potent. Pickled oysters and the pickled eggs of wild birds, honey garnered from opium poppies, jars of clotted cream. If it was rich, if it was delicious, if it was bad for a mortal to consume, it was probably in those crates.<br/>The immorality didn’t stop there. No, it went far beyond: for in a distant refrigeration locker, far above the sunny streets of Avalon, hung slaughtered and butchered animals, rotting on the hook to suitable tenderness for consumption. No Public Health Monitor could deal with this. He or she would be on his or her knees puking in the abattoir at the merest glance at all the bones and veins and muscles and slow-dripping nastiness … but to set aside the twenty-fourth century point of view for a moment, Victor had really bagged a lot of prime meat. Pheasants and grouse, a peacock, a wild boar, a sea turtle, a suckling pig and a calf, venison, and finally that ultimate martyr to humanity’s wickedness: a buffalo. Could anything be more deliciously perverse than to serve forth roasted buffalo to immortals who had spent the ages rescuing creatures from extinction?<br/></td>

<td>Child Care in the Cyborg Family, Volume Six:The Challenge of Psychological Development<br/>It might be reasonably supposed that the cyborg child, with his naturally augmented intelligence, would be free of the complex neuroses developed by mortal children; yet such is far from the case. This is particularly noticeable if the child is the recipient of memory files from a previous state of being. Unresolved issues of anger, abandonment, or guilt—most particularly the latter—may confer an adult burden of emotion the young cyborg’s psyche is incapable of easily integrating. As might be expected, the cyborg child will not resort to the rudimentary bad behaviour in which traumatised mortal children engage. He will develop far more colourful, imaginative, and complicated complexes with which to engage his concerned parents’ attention</td>

Nicholas prefers to practice on his mandolin.

I saw another life, the one I might have lived in some other Spain, where a little girl never fell into the hands of dubious strangers or the Inquisition. Bright and detailed as film, the brief lifetime unspooled itself for my consideration: the girl grew up and made her way to England somehow, and became the wife of a somewhat less outspoken young vicar named Nicholas Harpole. Forty years of wedded bliss in a thatched cottage, Sabbath sermons, living perhaps long enough to see a Shakespeare play. Then sunlight in the green churchyard, and quiet dust…<br/>We broke the surface and gasped for air, with shuddering pleasure. I heard the sea roaring. Edward tightened his grip and dove again, bearing me with him, and the roar grew louder. I saw white sails above a blue sea, brilliant sunlight. I saw an England where Commander Bell-Fairfax forbore to strike a senior officer, and came home a hero instead, and married a Spanish girl he met, perhaps in Gibraltar, where they settled down. Fifty years, perhaps, of respectability, thrifty life on an officer’s half-pay, a little stone house kept neat as a pin; then one monument carved with names and dates, loving husband, beloved wife.<br/>Up into the air again! I couldn’t get my breath; it didn’t matter. We were sinking together in the dark water but it was warm now, and I heard laughter. I saw a fantastic Eurospain as carefree as a travel poster, where Alec Checker-field went to party instead of going to Mars, and there during Purim carnival met a girl, and dared to try his luck at marriage a third time, and the third time was the charm. Dance clubs, endless serene cruises, a fashionable address in London. Would they have had sixty years, this life? Seventy? The end might have come quickly, or it might have lingered out in hospital corridors, but the end result the same: white ashes scattered on the seafoam, sinking into blue …<br/>But we were rising.

He was now ripping open the crates that were stacked inside.<br/>As the Enforcers entered, one by one, he tossed each a prepacked duffel. The first in caught his bundle, advanced to the far end of the cargo bay and waited. He was there joined by the next in line with his bundle, and the next.

The console beeped in acknowledgment and the autopilot activated; with a lurch and a whine the transport rose into the storm, and kept rising, and sped westward at last.<br/>The Enforcers, meanwhile, were busily dressing themselves out of the duffels. There was some muttered amusement, even laughter, at the clothing that had been provided for them. Not uniforms by any stretch of the imagination, no, in fact all the garments had in common was that they were all triple-X sizes. There were Levis and cotton fleece exercise pants, there were chinos and Bermuda shorts and pinstriped trousers. And the shirts! Pastel Izods, rugby pullovers, long-sleeved oxfords, T-shirts in all colors printed with every possible advertising logo, though there were perhaps more for the Hearst News Services 2348 Company Picnic than any other. It had not been easy to stockpile so many big clothes, in a world where the mortal race had dwindled. There were no shoes available at all.<br/>Having dressed themselves, the Yorkshire contingent was issued field rations and fed, as the transport hurtled on. They were then ordered to draw from their duffels the last items each man had been issued: two lengths of oak, six meters of ramilar cord, two flint nodules, and a hammerstone. It wasn’t necessary to tell them what to do next. To a man, they dropped into a comfortable crouch and their enormous supple hands went to work, expertly knapping stone. With almost no effort the flint axe heads began to take shape.<br/>They were beautiful things, in a horrible kind of way, faceted sharp as razors at one end and blunt and heavy at the other.

He had cried and cowered when the stone-tipped spears began to fly, hidden his face until the screaming stopped and he’d looked up into the pale eyes of the bearded giant. Why are you weeping, mortal child? his rescuer had said. This is the way of the world. He had built his immortal life on that wisdom.<br/>So had Gamaliel, though he had heard it from a very different person: stern-eyed Facilitator Amaunet, leaning down like a living shadow through shattered clay-and-stick walls to lift him from his dying mother’s arms. This is the way of the world, Amaunet had advised him, and then she had added: Look at the slaughter, mortal child. This is mortal evil. Gamaliel had never forgotten, even to this late hour when he was adjusting his tie and nodding to her over the roof of their limousine.<br/>And he had passed the wisdom on in his turn, when he had lifted the child who would be Aegeus from the smashed cart and showed him the whooping thieves playing ball with the head of the boy’s father. This is mortal evil, he had told the child. This is what the monkeys do. Never forget it.<br/>Nor had Aegeus ever forgotten, though he had built walls of graciousness around himself to contain the ugly truth, kept it locked away as though in a reliquary of gold and rock crystal, meant to hold something precious. Indeed, the truth was precious, and he had carefully gifted young Moreham with it, when he had found the child shivering, trying to warm himself at the ashes where bones smoldered. Aegeus had taken him up and set him before him in the saddle, and pointed out across all that the legions had left of Isurium. Never forget this, he had instructed. Never forgive them.<br/>There were indeed certain ideological differences among the immortals arriving for dinner. Certain heads were eagerly anticipating seeing certain other heads roll, so abiding was their mutual hatred. Yet all of them shared one common bond, in their profound loathing and contempt for mortal humanity. They had never forgotten. They would never forgive.<br/></td>

<td>Glances were exchanged here and there and there was a decided tension in the room as the waiters moved forward with the soup. No more than three ever came around the same side of the table at any one time, however, so as they moved off to busy themselves with bringing in the fish course everyone relaxed.<br/>Not so far that each dish wasn’t thoroughly scanned as it was set before them. But no trace of anything toxic was found; not in the poached salmon in mousseline sauce, nor the oysters, nor the braised sea turtle. Therefore, light and sparkling conversation accompanied the second course, with the appropriate white wines.<br/>It was dinner conversation of the highest caliber, too, refined to an art at tables in old Byzantium, in Pompeii and Amarna and Angkor Wat, polished in every beautiful doomed place that had ever spread its cloth for a pale horseman. Enough witty epigrams flew across that festal board to set Oscar Wilde’s shade moaning in envy.<br/>Still, nervous eyes tracked the waiters as they brought in the sorbet course</td>

<td>sheet of clean canvas has been laid out on the lawn, and compost thickly piled on it in the approximate shape of a man. Here and there distinct objects stand out from the main mass: a good-sized pumpkin where the head would be, and a jaunty pair of coconuts somewhere else. Glints of silver and wire, chips like fish scales, indicate the presence of electronic components incorporated into the body.<br/>Being incorporated into the body. For, even as Nicholas and Mendoza stare, the pile is altering: shifting, condensing, settling, as though alive with tiny moving things—which, in fact, it is. The effect just misses being unspeakably horrible, by virtue of the fact that the body is not decomposing but taking form.<br/>“I thought the pumpkin was a particularly nice touch,” says Edward, framing it with his hands. “Rather classical, don’t you think?”<br/>“I just redesigned a few nanobots like I said, and let ‘em multiply, and eyedroppered ‘em on, and they went crazy,” says Alec proudly. “Look how fast it’s going.”<br/>And indeed it is going quickly. Even as they stare, the pumpkin is shrinking in on itself, changing color. Its surface is beginning to pucker and morph into the semblance of a familiar face. Eyes form first. Mendoza accepts a sip of rum, watching the ongoing metamorphosis. “This is different,” she states, handing the bottle to Edward. “My gosh, is that a waistcoat forming? You’re making him with clothes already on?”<br/>“Yup,” says Alec. “I thought it’d save time. Neat, yeah? Clothes and beard and everything.”<br/></td>

Too bad you made me all-of-a-piece with the clothes.”<br/>“Huh?” Alec looked briefly away from the holo. “Well, but—there’s buttons and everything, right? They ought to unfasten. Most of the design template used your own self-image as a guide.”<br/>“Maybe the buttons undo at that.” The Captain’s eyes lit with wild surmise. He stood in the booth and, unbuttoning his coat, slipped it off cautiously.<br/>“Ugh! Now, that’s a right creepy feeling.” He held the coat against the table, then against his drink. “I got sensation in the coat like it was skin, even when it ain’t on. It don’t like being off me. Still…” He tugged experimentally at the cufflink on his right sleeve and worked it loose. With great care he rolled his sleeve up, an inch at a time. “Bloody hell, this feels funny.

YOU WILL STEP OVER THEIR BODIES AND RULE, NOW, WITH ME. ARE YOU NOT MY CHILD AND ONLY EQUAL?<br/>The white heat had flared into white flame. Nicholas raised his eyes to the gargantuan columns, the pulsing lights. Had Mendoza, and all the others like her, suffered over so many years for this thing? These were only symbols; and not of eternal truths but mere collected facts, and inaccurately recorded and outdated facts at that. So many receipts to millionaires for services rendered. The Temporal Concordance! The empty-eyed face smiled at him, as though they were the riches of the world.<br/>“No,” said Nicholas. “I know whose child I am, and what I am. You are only a false god.” And his flame rose to engulf him, wrath so pure he was in ecstasy, though he had battled all his life to keep it in check. Here, at last, was the purpose for which it existed. He became a column of fire and light; and, in that place of symbols, his white rage was a blazing sword in his hand.<br/>Nicholas attacked. In grim silence he shore away the arm of lightnings, the blind eyes, the loveless power, the cathedral of lies and half-truths, the guttering lamps of pomp and majesty. He brought it all down, did Nicholas; he destroyed a world.<br/>When it lay in ruins about him, Nicholas lowered the sword and looked on what he had done. He could hear, distantly, the wailing of mortals, the lamentation of machines. His wrath sank down, died. He saw in memory Mendoza’s face, her black eyes sad as she downloaded a chapter on revolutions.<br/>Here you go. Great heroes and the things they wrecked. Always easier to destroy something than to create something. It’s harder to plant a garden than to blow up a building, and undoubtedly more boring, but you just might need to do it one day, eh?<br/>Nicholas bowed his head. His will took shape as a lute in his hands. He cradled it in his arms, tuned its strings, and played.</td>

With a wordless cry of sorrow she sank down and took the slave’s head in her lap, stroking back his hair. He blinked, he tried to speak but couldn’t get a word out in his surprise.<br/>“He’s hurt, my poor hero is hurt, my bad uncle shot him and spoiled his poor biomechanicals after he’d worked so hard to get them online again, but you’ll help him, I know you will,” Tiara prattled happily to the big man. “For who is so brave or so clever as you?”<br/>The man turned his head, considering Tiara, arching one eyebrow. Then he looked back at her slave. Leaning down, he took the slave’s hand in his own and gripped it firmly. “A-ah!” cried the slave, as something seemed to flow down his arm from the man’s arm, and then he arched his back and gasped and shuddered. His skin flushed with color, his lungs filled with breath. The woman held him as his whole body convulsed, once and twice and a third time. He shut his eyes, opening them again after a long moment.<br/>Tiara, leaning close, saw his pupils dilate and contract.

It’s the Treasure Island, it’s the Adventure Island, it’s Ogygia,” she screamed. “We’ll be safe there!” And she paddled away toward it, towing him after her.<br/>The waves rolled and tumbled them ashore, and how heavy Tiara’s slave was as she struggled to help him from the water. Exhilarated as she was to be having an adventure at last, she was still weakened and half blinded by the blazing sun as it rose. She wept as she pulled her slave into the shade, onto a grassy lawn that sloped down to the beach.<br/>“Don’t cry,” he told her. He groped for her trembling hand. “Don’t be afraid, child. Just let me rest a little. We’ll make another plan.”<br/>“But we left your vitamins,” she sobbed. “And what if this is the Cyclopes’ island? Or there might be cannibals, or pirates.” She looked fearfully out at the big boat.<br/>“I really don’t think—” he began, but was interrupted by her shrill cry. She had just turned around and looked into the interior of the island, and seen to her astonishment that the lawn where they lay was only the edge of a vast and beautifully tended garden. It was bright with flowers, it was shaded by trees heavy with fruit, and there were pergolas and balustraded stairs leading somewhere, but Tiara didn’t notice where, exactly; for standing not a stone’s throw away on the green lawn were a big man and a woman. They were staring at Tiara and her slave, in astonishment no less great than her own.<br/>They walked forward. Tiara cringed above her slave to protect him, blinking desperately in the brightness, trying to see them clearly. “What is it?” The slave turned his head this way and that.<br/>“Oh please,” Tiara whimpered. They kept coming, and she glanced sidelong at the woman and turned to peer at the man, but she had to crane her head back to look, he was so tall, he went up and up against the green trees—<br/>Her mouth fell open, and then her little face was radiant with joy and relief. “Oh, it’s you,” she said. “Oh, we’re saved!

<td> that’s where Edward Alton Bell-Fairfax (late Commander, R.N., also semi-retired Prometheus) putters around, pruning fruit trees and roses for his wife, pretending not to rule the universe. He and Mendoza take tea on the terrace every epoch/evening, and wait for their—sons? Other selves? Other halves? Whatever the hell the relationship is—to come home from work. Just like any other family. Almost.<br/>And speaking of families: it was agreed that no more immortals would be made, ever. No more stealing mortal children and putting them through years of surgery and programming. But when it was discovered that Edward and Mendoza had figured out a way to have babies … what a surprise! It turned out there were a lot of immortal women, and no few men for that matter, who had secretly longed for the chance to have kids of their own all these years.<br/>I thought it was a really dumb idea, but despite my—choke—family relationship with the holy trinity, my opinion doesn’t carry a lot of weight. Edward feels that proper parenting skills are important, in fact indispensable to immortals, that if we’d had a chance to develop them there wouldn’t have been creeps like Labienus and Aegeus.<br/>So anyone applying to Captain Morgan (how’d you like to have him for your OB-GYN?) gets advice, assistance with producing embryos from DNA and implantation, and—oh yeah—a great big autographed copy of Child Care in the Cyborg Family, all nine million volumes of it. Kids that come with a manual, no less. Latif and Sarai have had a child. Kalugin and Nan are having one, too. Soon there’ll be a whole new generation of happy, well-adjusted little immortals with no memory of human pain and all of time and space to play in.</td>

<td>For purposes of the experiment, these waves describe the probability of a particle being found at any given location between the electron gun and the screen. Until a particle is detected by some<br/>  consciousness at a specific point along the wave, its location remains theoretical. Therefore, until a particle is observed passing through one slit, it could be equally anticipated to pass through<br/>  either – and thus will actually propagate through both in the form of probability waves. These wave systems interfere with each other at regular intervals and thereby assemble a visible<br/>  interference pattern on the capture screen behind the slits. But if a particle is detected by an observer at one slit, then that excludes the possibility of it passing through the other; and if it<br/>  can’t propagate through both, it can’t compile an interference pattern.<br/><br/>   This would seem self-contradictory, except for one thing.

E, F, and G are middling. H is long; we can chalk that up to the surprisingly large number of words that begin with “hand-” and “hyper-.” I, J, and K are relatively tiny. Then you begin the long middle section of the alphabet: L, M, N, O, and P, which always seem longer than they should be, probably because they go by so quickly in the ABC song. Q is a barely registered dip in the road, and you’re back into R, velocity maintained, corners rounded. T is a decent size, and U surprises you (all those “un-” words). V is a comparative breeze; W is about as long as it sounds—double U. X, Y, and Z are nothing, nada, the long stretch after the marathon.<br/> You’ll notice a letter missing from that litany, and that is because it merits special mention. S is, to put it in the modern vernacular, the worst. It is the longest letter in the book and an absolute heartbreaker, because you can see the end of the alphabet from it, and you know that once you clear S, you are moving on to T–Z, and half of those are barely even letters.

<td>The vital thing is to ensure the right mixture of seeds for procreation, coarse harmonizing with fine and fine with coarse. Another important factor is diet: some foods thicken the seeds in the body, others in turn thin and diminish them. A third factor of great importance is the mode in which the pleasures of intercourse are enjoyed. It is thought that women conceive more readily in the manner of four-footed beasts in a prone posture with loins uplifted so as to give access to the seed. Certainly, wives have no need of lascivious movements. A woman makes conception more difficult by offering a mock resistance and accepting Venus with a wriggling body. She diverts the furrow from the straight course of the ploughshare and makes the seed fall wide of the plot. These tricks are employed by prostitutes for their own ends, so that they may not conceive too frequently and be laid up by pregnancy and at the same time may make intercourse more attractive to men. But obviously our wives can have no use for them.</td>

Vent the seed of love upon other objects. By clinging to it you assure yourself the certainty of heart-sickness and pain. With nourishment the festering sore quickens and strengthens.

His eyes were the clear crystal blue of the sky after rain has washed away the summer heat, his complexion as pale and flawless as porcelain, and his hair the radiant silver-gold of dew illuminated by a sunrise. I know it sounds ridiculous, but fair folk require such comparisons. There’s simply no other way to describe them. Once, a Whimsical poet died of despair after finding himself unequal to the task of capturing a fair one’s beauty in simile. I think it more likely he died of arsenic poisoning, but so the story goes.<br/> You must keep in mind, of course, that all of this is only a glamour, not what they really look like underneath.<br/> Fair folk are talented dissemblers, but they can’t lie outright. Their glamour always has a flaw. Gadfly’s flaw was his fingers; they were far too long to be human and sometimes appeared oddly jointed. If someone looked at his hands too long he would lace them together or scurry them under a napkin like a pair of spiders to put them out of sight. He was the most personable fair one I knew, far more relaxed about manners than the rest of them, but staring was never a good idea—unless, like me, you had a good reason to.<br/> Finally, Gadfly ate the cake.

In Central America before the Spanish conquest, the Maya developed elaborate games similar to basketball, which kept spectators busy for weeks on end. In our times, disenfranchised minorities depend on sports and entertainment as avenues to social mobility-basketball, baseball, boxing, and popular music absorb surplus psychic energy while promising wealth and fame.</td>

Of course this does not mean that these functions need to be the only purpose of sex. For example, the adaptive function of taste buds was to distinguish between wholesome and spoiled food, but with time we developed complex culinary arts based on subtle nuances of taste. So also whatever were the original reasons for sexual pleasure, it can always be used to yield new possibilities for enriching life. But just as gluttony that has no relationship to hunger seems unnatural, an obsession with sex that is divorced from other human needs such as intimacy, caring, and commitment becomes equally aberrant.</td>

It is “retro” because it reproduces itself in a way that’s backward from how most life-forms manage this wonderful trick. In the nucleus of each cell in our body, and we have an awful lot of them, the genetic recipe for building our entire body can be found. Every cell has the complete list of instructions. Those genes are packed in DNA, tightly coiled molecules of nucleic acids. To make use of all the instructions in our genes, certain enzymes unwind the DNA helix in the cell’s nucleus. But to ensure that the precious DNA is not lost, another enzyme swoops in and makes a copy of the DNA needed. This is called transcription. This copy is made literally backward and has a few special alterations. (One of these alterations is to a base called uracil, a molecule whose origin may be extraterrestrial—yes, really.) The copy is called ribonucleic acid, or RNA. The RNA blueprint is then transported from the nucleus to a ribosome, which, once it gets its hands on the RNA, translates the backward code and makes proteins from the blueprint.<br/>			 DNA  RNA  Protein <br/>			 Simple as one, two, three. For decades, this definition of the process, made by Francis Crick, the codiscoverer of DNA with James Watson, was considered scientific dogma. That is how life works. So imagine how surprising it was when scientists discovered that a virus could run in the opposite direction. Retroviruses forced scientists to question what defines life. Here was an organism with a genetic code of its own but with no cell to house it. Can you be alive if you hold the blueprint to life but have to borrow the construction plant from another organism? Can there be life outside a cell? Taxonomists have spent decades debating this, perhaps pointlessly. As Carl Zimmer argues in A Planet of Viruses, “Trying to find a moment in time when such RNA-life abruptly became ‘alive’ just distracts us from the gradual transition to life as we know it.”<br/>			 This is what retroviruses do. They trick our cells into making the proteins they need, as directed from their RNA. Instead of starting with DNA, HIV holds all its genetic information as RNA. The virus exists as two simple strands of RNA packaged into a spiky protein shell containing all the enzymes it needs. The viral RNA</td>

<td>A perfectly planned experiment faced with the chaos of reality often collapses. But, with persistence and experience, some will succeed. Part of maturing as a scientist is recognizing these moments, understanding when to pack it in and when to keep going. Walker, at the very beginning of his career, wasn’t sure which to do. Morose, he sat looking over the botched data. Joe Sodroski, the researcher he wasn’t supposed to disturb, came up to him. “What are you working on?” Sodroski asked, concerned about Walker’s despondent attitude. Walker told Sodroski what he was trying to do and how nothing was working. Much to his surprise, Sodroski had the solution.<br/>			 Using Sodroski’s suggestions, Walker was able to get a unique model for HIV up and running. From their conversation, he devised an artificial system in which B cells taken from patients are engineered to express individual parts of HIV. He then measured the ability of killer T cells, the storm troopers, to respond specifically to each piece. With this scheme, he was able to dissect the components of the T cell response to the virus, teasing out which parts of HIV initiate a response. Taking the storm trooper cells from their first HIV patient, Walker’s team was excited to finally measure how the body responded to HIV. What they found was dramatic. In people infected with HIV, their storm trooper T cells specifically target and kill HIV-infected cells. These killer cells knew who or what they were looking for. When storm trooper cells were taken from people not infected with the HIV virus, the cells did not know what they were looking for. This data was the first indication that the body can mount a specific response to HIV.<br/>			 Walker’s advisor knew this would be a big paper.</td>

Together we look at a face that is placid and impassive but not fixed or frozen—a supple, blood-in-the-cheeks vision of what the goddess of wisdom looked like, her beauty all sturdiness and strength. “Athena was the goddess of a special kind of wisdom,” I tell them. “Have you read the Odyssey? You have—perfect. In the Odyssey, Athena shows up every time Odysseus needs a jolt of confidence and inspiration. You know the feeling…. You’re stumbling around feeling blah and out of nowhere your mood lightens and you have the energy and courage and clarity required to do something that felt impossible moments before. Today we would think that the change came from inside us, but the Greeks didn’t believe that. For them, all forces originated in the external world, forces that were powerful and unpredictable and grabbed hold of people’s emotions just like it controlled their fates. Athena was sometimes called the goddess of nearness because of the way she could penetrate and transform minds”—I gesture to the face—“for the better, wouldn’t you say? Look at her awhile. Look at what the Greeks thought wisdom looked like. See if she improves your mood.”<br/> Perhaps they are patronizing me, but they nod along like I’m making sense</td>

First, we have a faculty of awareness at the heart of our hearts, a piece of our consciousness fine-tuned to perceive reality, an unmediated ability to apprehend the world’s beauty and sublimity such that the Real (or God) feels near and unconcealed. It is the type of seeing the mihrab inspires in me.<br/> But we also have our logical brains, and they remind us how little we’ve seen of the world and what small means we have of deciphering its ultimate reality (or manifold realities).

As far as I can make out, designers always began with the circle, the simplest and most primordial shape, which they would subdivide to tease out implied shapes inscribed within. By choosing to erase certain lines and extend and repeat others outward over an infinite grid, they created innumerable patterns that were all derived from the original circle, which in its oneness was emblematic of God. The final product would contain no visible trace of the circle but stood as a demonstration of the unity that underlies multiplicity, a tenet of the Muslim faith.</td>

<td>Much of the sensing done by these tiny organisms is aimed at finding food and avoiding toxins. Even in the earliest work on E. coli, though, it seemed that something else was going on. They were also attracted to chemicals they could not eat. Biologists who work on these organisms are more and more inclined to see the senses of bacteria as attuned to the presence and activities of other cells around them, not just to washes of edible and inedible chemicals. The receptors on the surfaces of bacterial cells are sensitive to many things, and these include chemicals that bacteria themselves tend to excrete for various reasons—sometimes just as overflow of metabolic processes. This may not sound like much, but it opens an important door. Once the same chemicals are being sensed and produced, there is the possibility of coordination between cells. We have reached the birth of social behavior.<br/> An example is quorum sensing. If a chemical is both produced and sensed by a particular kind of bacterium, it can be used by those bacteria to assess how many individuals of the same kind are around. By doing this, they can work out whether enough bacteria are nearby for it to be worthwhile to produce a chemical that does its job only if many cells make it at once.</td>

<td><br/> A bacterium is so small that its sensors alone can give it no indication of the direction that a good or bad chemical is coming from. To overcome this problem, the bacterium uses time to help it deal with space. The cell is not interested in how much of a chemical is present at any given moment, but rather in whether that concentration is increasing or decreasing. After all, if the cell swam in a straight line simply because the concentration of a desirable chemical was high, it might travel away from chemical nirvana, not toward it, depending on the direction it’s pointing. The bacterium solves this problem in an ingenious manner: as it senses its world, one mechanism registers what conditions are like right now, and another records how things were a few moments ago. The bacterium will swim in a straight line as long as the chemicals it senses seem better now than those it sensed a moment ago. If not, it’s preferable to change course.</td>

The rowers together can propel the boat forward, but even if they are vigorous, their individual actions will not get the boat to go anywhere unless they coordinate what they’re doing. It doesn’t matter exactly when they pull their oar, as long as they pull at the same time. One way to deal with this situation is to have someone call the “stroke.</td>

Both of these roles can be played at the same time and there’s no conflict between them. Getting a boat to move requires the coordination of micro-actions, but someone also needs to watch where the boat is going. The person calling the stroke, the coxswain or “cox,” usually acts as the crew’s eyes and as a coordinator of micro-actions. The same combination can be seen in a nervous system.</td>

<td>important. Through much of the twentieth century, a sensory-motor view of the evolution of nervous systems was simply assumed, and it took some time for the second view, the one based on internal coordination, to become clear. Chris Pantin, an English biologist, developed the second view in the 1950s and it has been revived recently by Fred Keijzer, a philosopher. They rightly point out that it’s easy to fall into the habit of thinking of each “action” as a single unit, in which case the only problem left to solve is coordinating these acts with the senses, working out when to do X rather than Y. As organisms get bigger and can do more, that picture becomes more and more inaccurate. It ignores the problem of how an organism is able to do X or Y in the first place. Pressing an alternative to the sensory-motor theory was a good thing. I’ll call this the action-shaping view of the role played by early nervous systems.<br/> Returning to the history</td>

Having binocular vision helps primates judge distances and move about more quickly and more safely around the canopy.

<td>The foundations of our relationship with wood lie in its remarkable properties. As an all-round structural material it is unmatched. It is lighter than water, yet weight for weight is as stiff, strong, and tough as steel and can resist both being stretched and compressed. It is easy to shape, as it readily splits along the grain, and is soft enough to carve, especially when green. It can be found in pieces large enough to hold up houses, yet can be cut up into tools as small as a toothpick. It can last for centuries if it is kept permanently dry or wet, yet it can also be burned to keep us warm, to cook our food, and drive a wide range of industrial processes. With all these advantages, the central role of wood in the human story was not just explicable, but inevitable.</td>

<td>There was probably some truth to what Anna was saying. But Tyler couldn’t help but remember how, when he was young, every year on January 17 it snowed on their colony in Connecticut. There was no meteorological explanation, but legend had it that a beautiful Indian maid, a daughter of winter, had died on that day, and every year since, the sky wept cold snowy tears for her. And as a boy it was a fact that if you caught exactly twenty fireflies in a jar, then let them all out before you went to bed, you’d sleep through the night without bad dreams. Some things couldn’t be explained. Some things could. Sometimes you liked the explanation. Sometimes you didn’t. That’s when you called it myth.</td>

<td>Well?” he asked, trying unsuccessfully to sound bored. “What did you find?” Eli tightened his grip on the steering wheel as he drove toward Lockland. “Trauma.” “What about it?” “It was the only commonality I could find in all the cases of EOs that are even close to well-documented. Anyway, bodies react in strange ways under stress. Adrenaline and all that, as you know. I figured that trauma could cause the body to chemically alter.” He began to speak faster. “But the problem is, trauma is such a vague word, right? It’s a whole blanket, really, and I needed to isolate a thread. Millions of people are traumatized daily. Emotionally, physically, what-have-you. If even a fraction of them became ExtraOrdinary, they would compose a measurable percentage of the human population. And if that were the case EOs would be more than a thing in quotation marks, more than a hypothesis; they’d be an actuality. I knew there had to be something more specific.” “A genre of trauma? Like car accidents?” asked Victor. “Yes, exactly, except there weren’t indicators of any common trauma. No obvious formula. No parameters. Not at first.” Eli let his words hang in the car. Victor turned the radio from low to off. Eli was practically bouncing in his seat. “But?” prompted Victor, cringing at his own obvious interest. “But I started digging,” said Eli, “and the few case studies I could dig up—unofficial ones, of course, and this shit was a pain to find—the people in them weren’t just traumatized, Vic. They died. I didn’t see it at first because nine times out of ten when a person doesn’t stay dead, it isn’t even recorded as an NDE. Hell, half the time people don’t realize they’ve had an NDE.” “NDE?” Eli glanced over at Victor. “Near death experience. What if an EO isn’t a product of just any trauma? What if their bodies are reacting to the greatest physical and psychological trauma possible? Death. Think about it, the kind of transformation we’re talking about wouldn’t be possible with a physiological reaction alone, or a psychological reaction alone. It would require a huge influx of adrenaline, of fear, awareness. We talk about the power of will, we talk about mind over matter, but it’s not one over the other, it’s both at once. The mind and the body both respond to imminent death, and in those cases where both are strong enough—and both would have to be strong, I’m talking about genetic predisposition and will to survive—I think you might have a recipe for an EO.” Victor’s mind whirred as he listened to Eli’s theory. He flexed his fingers against his pant legs. It made sense. It made sense and it was simple and elegant and Victor hated that, especially because he should have seen it first, should have been able to hypothesize. Adrenaline was his research topic. The only difference was that he’d been studying temporary flux, and Eli had gone so far as to suggest a permanent shift. Anger flared through him, but anger was unproductive so he twisted it into pragmatism while he searched for a flaw. “</td>

<td>Let’s say you’re right,” pressed Victor, “and it’s a simple equation: a near death experience, with an emphasis on the near, plus a certain level of physical stamina, and a strong will—” “But you’re the one who said it’s not simple, that there have to be more factors.” “Oh, I’m sure there are,” said Victor. But he had Eli’s attention. He liked having his attention. “Who knows how many factors? But I’m willing to admit that the body is capable of incredible things in life-threatening situations. That’s what my thesis has been about, remember? And maybe you’re right. Maybe the body is even capable of a fundamental chemical shift. Adrenaline has given people seemingly superhuman abilities in times of dire need. Glimpses of power. Perhaps there’s a way to make the change a lasting one.</td>

Il eût dû penser à l&#39;usure des cordes, à celle de la charpente, au danger de la cloche elle-même, qui tombe tous les deux siècles, et réfléchir au moyen de diminuer le salaire des sonneurs, ou de les payer par quelque indulgence8 ou autre grâce tirée des trésors de l&#39;Église, et qui n&#39;aplatit pas sa bourse.<br/> Au lieu de ces sages réflexions, l&#39;âme de Julien, exaltée par ces sons si mâles et si pleins, errait dans les espaces imaginaires.

He said, ‘For those of you peeking over the fence at Christianity, you don’t clean yourself up before you get in the shower. You just jump right in.’ I started bawling. Something clicked. So I made the decision that this was the path I would follow. Over time the pieces started to fall into place, I started reading books, talking to people, and continued going to church. One book said that in relationships, being spouse-centered creates too much pressure. Being self-centered means you become your own God. That doesn’t work either. You have to be God-centered.</td>

What about all those dreams I’d had of travel and not conforming to the usual expectations?<br/>			 One evening around the dinner table I stared down at my hands, fumbling with how to begin.<br/>			 My mom slid her hand across the table and took mine in hers, “You know you don’t have to go to college right now, right?”<br/>			 I looked up at her. I hated the idea of worrying her, and in that moment I saw that she looked hopeful.<br/>			 “Listen,” my dad began, “school will always be there for you when you really want it.”<br/>			 I almost laughed.

His expression turned serious. “But there’ve got to be a few things we make clear.”<br/>			 The few things were truly a small number. This was to be a reality check for me. I could raid the pantry to start out and whenever I came back through Estes. Other than that, no financial support. Though he didn’t say this, I sensed that my dad wanted me to experience the dirtbag life. I also think he thought that I might enjoy it. As usual, he was right. Funny thing was, I’d been wondering for a while if getting some space from him would help me find the direction I needed.

When he got to a hard section he didn’t waste energy needlessly flailing around. Instead he would stop, hang on the rope, and study the holds. He would temporarily mark the key bumps with bits of chalk and map out a sequence. Then he would massage his fingers into the rock, let each crystal settle into his skin, figuring out how much pressure he needed to apply.
